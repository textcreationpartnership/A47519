            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </gap>hem into the World, with ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon his pious deſign, and the uſefulneſs of Tracts of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>The plainneſs of the ſtile muſt be no diſcouragement to the Reader, nor muſt Truth be therefore laid by, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it comes not dreſt in a Veſture of Gold, or wants the Curioſities of Embroidery.</p>
            <p>Truth needs no borrow'd Beams,
<pb facs="tcp:41019:3"/>
its natural Light is enough to ſtrike the Senſes. If it be Truth, it is no matter whether it's preſented in an Earthen Veſſel, or in a Silver Diſh.</p>
            <p>The ſerving of it up according to the Mode, may indeed pleaſe ſickly Fancies, but is no great Charm or Motive to inquiſitive, or rational Men, who love Beauty without paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and are more taken with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural mixture of white and red, than with all the artificial Waſhes, which are uſed to make the Features ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Plat. <hi>l.</hi> 2. de Republ. Ariſtot. <hi>l.</hi> 6. Politic. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note>The Welfare of a Common-Wealth doth in a great meaſure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Duties of the Relatives here treated of, and did Parents and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren conſcientiouſly diſcharge all the Obligations incumbent upon them by the Law of God, and Nature, the World could not be ſo wicked as it is. Education makes the firſt impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions upon the Souls of Men, and
<pb facs="tcp:41019:3"/>
were care taken, that the ground be impregnated with good Seed, ſuch a Harveſt might be expected from it, that Poſterity might be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for it.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible that Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the Humour of the Age, is apt to make ſtrange alterations in the Principles we imbibe, yet ſomething will ſtick, and when the thoughts are cool, and Men come to reflect, the Principles they have learned when the wax was ſoft, will recoil, and oblige them to return to their Duty.</p>
            <p>Of this we have experience; and though there is no rule ſo general, but admits of exceptions, yet it's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that this effect doth frequently appear, which is no inconſiderable Motive to the ſerious conſideration of a thing of this importance.</p>
            <p>It was a wiſe anſwer, which one of the <hi>LXXII. Interpreters</hi> gave to <hi>Ptolemaeus Philadelphus,</hi> who asked him, what was the greateſt negligence? <hi>The neglect,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>of the good
<pb facs="tcp:41019:4"/>
Education of Children.</hi> It is ſo, and the hurt that's done by it, both to them, and to the Publick, is unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>Whence is it that there are ſo many Prodigals? that ſo many come to an untimely end? that ſo many run into exceſſes, which deſtroy both Soul and Body? From want of pious Education.</p>
            <p>It was a ſevere Cenſure, which <hi>Carneades</hi> the Philoſopher paſſed upon the Children of Rich Men, <hi>that they learned nothing but to ride well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed it is to be wondered, that Rational Creatures ſhould be ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to breed up their Progeny to ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, and neglect the cultivation of that which makes them differ from Bruits, and ſhews, they are Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of a nobler extract: Can any thing be more reaſonable, than vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and the fear of God? Is not this it, which both Scripture and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy teaches? Do not we our ſelves
<pb facs="tcp:41019:4"/>
confeſs ſo much, and do not moſt Men acknowledge it when they come to dye? And yet that we ſhould make this the leaſt part of our care in the Education of Youth, is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous ſtrange!</p>
            <p>Some ſeem to fancy, that ſending their Children to School, or to teach them their Catechiſm, is all the Care that is incumbent upon them. Though I cannot ſay, but that this is a Duty, yet it is ſo imperfect, that I can ſcarce honour it with the Title of doing it by halves, it being but the beginning, or the leaſt part of it. Inſtruction, Precept, and Example are the mighty Engines and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the promoting and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing this Work; and perhaps no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hath a greater influence than Example; for all the Moral Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Parents, are like Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpilt upon the Ground, where Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample doth not concomitate the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>How ſhall the Child learn Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb facs="tcp:41019:5"/>
where the Father is often drunk? Or how is it poſſible, the young man ſhould be meek and patient, where the Father is Cholerick, and hath no command of his paſſion? I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the Grace of God, and am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that the very impiety of the Parents hath ſometimes contrary Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects upon certain Children, and they learn to be good by the Wickedneſs of their Superiors; but this is an extraordinary Providence, which God exerts ſometimes to manifeſt his Omnipotence, and to let men ſee that he can bring light out of darkneſs, but the ordinary way of Edifying thoſe under our Charge, is to teach them by Example.</p>
            <p>And though even this proves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual ſometimes, yet it's enough that it is our Duty, and that we have diſcharged it, and have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that way which was moſt ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and of God's preſcription.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I will let you ſee,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>what Education you are to give to a Daughter, whoſe Soul ought to be the Temple of God. Let her hear nothing, learn nothing, ſpeak nothing, but what may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire the fear of God into her. Let her not liſten to prophane Diſcourſes, nor be enamoured with Love Songs or amorous Ditties. Let her uſe her ſelf at certain hours, to ſing Pſalms; let none be about her, but ſober Servants, and keep her from running into Company light and vain, where ſhe will learn more ill than good. Uſe her to reading, and to work, and labour, and promiſe her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and incite her to Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; excite her to Virtue by prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Commendations, and make her ambitious to excel others in Virtue and good Works. Let her
<pb facs="tcp:41019:6"/>
learn Scripture Sentences by heart, and chuſe her a Maſter, that may not only teach her to read, but inſtruct her in good manners. Give her a Nurſe neither debaucht nor tatling, nor given to ſtrong Liquors; and let her Habit be modeſt, and ſuch as becomes her Chriſtian Profeſſion. Let her not bore Holes in her Ears for Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, neither let her uſe any Paint or Waſh to beautifie her ſelf. Let her not be nice in ordering the Hair of her Head, neither ſuffer her to adorn her ſelf with Gold or Pearls or precious Stones, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you deſign her for Hell fire: When ſhe comes to riper age, let her go with her Parents to the Temple, but let her not return to the Gayeties of the World. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe her to keep her ſelf in her Chamber, and let her not go to Feaſts, and merry Meetings. I would not have her uſe too much Faſting and Abſtinence, which
<pb facs="tcp:41019:6"/>
may hurt her health, at leaſt till ſhe be ſtronger, and better able to bear it. Let her uſe God's Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for neceſſity, and not for voluptuouſneſs ſake. Suffer her not to be at Muſical concerts, nor to be fond of Fiddles, and Lutes, and Harps, but let her repeat e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day ſome paſſages out of the Word of God. Let her not go abroad any where without her Mother, nor be very familiar, or enter into intreagues with any Servant. Appoint her a Governeſs that's ſage and wiſe, and who may teach her to riſe at midnight, to ſing Praiſes to her God. Let her pray and work Day and Night. Teach her to handle her Needle, to ſpin and to exerciſe her ſelf in turning the Spindle. Suffer her not to imploy her ſelf in Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broideries of Gold and Silver. Let her Clothes be plain and decent, and let her eat ſoberly and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, and let her not take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <pb facs="tcp:41019:7"/>I know what will be objected here, that this is the advice of a <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,</hi> and to teach a Daughter how to be a <hi>Nun.</hi> But ſtill I appeal to any unprejudiced perſon, whether this be not the moſt likely way to Salvation, and whether theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts be not agreeable to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Chriſt? And though I will grant, that all are not under the ſame Circumſtances, and all cannot give the ſame Education; yet as to the principal part of the advice, which is to teach Children by Word and Example, how to die to Sin and to the World, it muſt be granted it's very practicable. This Age in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed hath learnt to ſhake off theſe ſtricter Rules, but they ſhould ſhew us too, what Warrant they have from the Word of God to do ſo.</p>
            <p>It was judiciouſly obſerved of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi> that a <hi>ſoft and effeminate E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, breaks the ſtrength of Body and Mind,</hi> and whilſt we breed up Children to all the Arts

of Vanity and Luxury, they continue ſtrangers to God and to themſelves.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vine</hi> grows <hi>wild,</hi> if it be not cut; ſo doth <hi>Youth,</hi> if they be not betimes curbed in things which war againſt the Soul.</p>

               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand this, ye <hi>Parents,</hi> and be inſtructed, ye to whom God hath committed the care of Education; ye are God's Stewards, and your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are the Goods you are to manage to your Maſter's Glory. Their blood God will require at your hands. Have not ye read the Curſe God pronounced againſt <hi>Eli</hi> for his negligence, and are not ye afraid of the ſame Judgment? Ye are the perſons by whom your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren muſt be taught to ſerve God in their Generation; ye are the perſons from whom they are to learn their Duty to God and Man; at your door the fault will lie, if they miſcarry through your careleſneſs. Are their Souls ſo contemptible in your eyes, that you will let them periſh for want of Admonition? Did Chriſt think them
<pb facs="tcp:41019:8"/>
worth purchaſing with his own Blood, and will ye let them lie without fence or wall, or cultivation?</p>
            <p>You take care that they may live comfortably in this World: Is it not a greater Duty to beſtir your ſelves, that they may enjoy God for ever? It is joy to you to ſee them do well here, and ought it not to be a greater joy to find, that they are like to reign with Chriſt and his Saints in a better World? You love them, but how doth it appear you do, while you let their Souls die? Is this your Love, to provide for their fleſh, and to neglect enriching their better part with reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Principles? You would have them go to Heaven when they die; but how is it poſſible they ſhould, when you are loth to be at the trouble to ſhew them the way that leads to that Paradiſe? Was ever any man ſaved without Holineſs, and do you hope they will be, without this qualification? If you teach them not by Word and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to practiſe that Holineſs, how
<pb facs="tcp:41019:8"/>
can you or they hope to aſcend into the Mount of God, or dwell on the everlaſting Hills?</p>
            <p>Do you believe a future Account, and do not ye enquire, whether you diſcharge your Duty to your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? Or is this no part of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ye are to give? Ye are the perſons who are to breathe goodneſs into them, and to give them life and happineſs. Ye are their Gods, as it were, and from you they receive their motion; and their ſpiritual as well as their natural life muſt begin from you. Ye are Magiſtrates in your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and it is your Province to be a terrour to evil doers, and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragers of thoſe that do well.</p>
            <p>If by your indulgence they ſin, and by your connivence they grow wicked, will not the ſupreme Judge be aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on ſuch Officers? You blame Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of a Commonwealth, if they do not adnimadvert on Offenders, or are regardleſs of the reins of Juſtice; and do not you blame your ſelves,
<pb facs="tcp:41019:9"/>
who are Commanders in your Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, for ſuffering the fear of God to decay there, which is the only thing that can make them happy?</p>
            <p>How is it, that you will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand your intereſt? Is it not your intereſt to educate them into the Practice of Virtue, and Goodneſs, and Self-denial? If they love God, they muſt needs love you, that love will conſtrain them to expreſs their Duty to you. The Preſence of God will over-awe them, and they'l obey you, not with eye-ſervice, but when your eye is off from them. The fear of God will make them conſcientious of obeying your Commands in ſecret; and if your good Counſels and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples prevail with them, they will be not only your Children, but the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God; and you will have this ſatisfaction, that you do not only love them, but that God loves them, and dwells in them, and they in him.</p>
            <p>Remember this, ye that are <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> and let this encourage you to
<pb facs="tcp:41019:9"/>
a faithful diſcharge of your Duty. Your Parents, that under God gave you life, have a juſt Right to your Services and Obedience. You are born Servants to them, and to be at their beck and command is the obligation you bring with you into the World. As the Authority of Parents was the firſt Government in the World, ſo your ſubjection to them is the firſt Service that was ever known in the World. Can you think any thing too good for them, who are the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of conveying to you all the goods you poſſeſs, and all the endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments you are inveſted with?</p>
            <p>If you follow not their good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and Admonitions, ye are the greateſt Rebels in the World, and the ſin is as great a Treaſon in the Family you live in, as Sedition in a Kingdom is againſt the State. You have the nobleſt Promiſes made you to reward your Obedience; and though it is a natural Duty bound up with your very Being, yet God will
<pb facs="tcp:41019:10"/>
reward it as if it were a deliberate ſelf-denial; and becauſe you ſhall not ſtay for the recompence, God will bleſs you here, and your lives ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable on this ſide Heaven. It is the firſt Commandment in the Law with Promiſe; and to let you ſee how God delights in your honouring your Parents, and obeying their wholeſom Counſels, he hath ſingled out that Precept, and dreſs'd it with more than ordinary encouragements.</p>
            <p>But then, the Honour you ſhew them, muſt not ſpend it ſelf in ſome outward Civilities, but muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in Actions, in Speeches, and in Patience, according to the Advice of the Son of <hi>Syrach, Eccleſiaſtic. 3.12, 13, 14.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Actions, ſo as to execute their lawful Commands with great alacrity and fidelity, to labour, and to take pains for their maintenance and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, if they are fallen to decay, and to relieve their neceſſities, according to your ability.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:41019:10"/>In Words and Speeches, ſo as to ſpeak honourably of them, to anſwer them with humility, to comfort them when they are in trouble, and to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie them with ſoft language, when they are angry and diſpleaſed.</p>
            <p>In Patience, ſo as to bear their anger patiently, and to endure their frowardneſs and pettiſhneſs without contradiction; to receive their ſeverer Commands, and ſuch as are contrary to your genius and inclination, with gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to do them without murmuring.</p>
            <p>Theſe are Duties which draw more than ordinary Bleſſings upon you, God that ſees you do ſo, will have thoughts of peace towards you; he will be concerned for you, and you may be confident, he will not leave you, nor forſake you.</p>
            <p>In honouring your Parents, you ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour your ſelves. It's that which will not only procure you favour with God, but with men too. It's upon this account, that Wiſe men have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded the Dutifulneſs of ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb facs="tcp:41019:11"/>
Children, and made them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal by their Writings; and there are ſuch Examples of this filial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, even among the Heathen, that it would be odious and dreadful, if the Children of Chriſtians ſhould fall ſhort of their Duty.</p>
            <p>God lays ſo great a ſtreſs upon it, that as he promiſes the kindeſt things to it, ſo he threatens as ſevere pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, where it is neglected; and that he doth not only threaten, but execute theſe Judgments, any man may ſee, that will take notice of his Providences. But all this the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will be more fully convinced of, by reading the following Diſcourſe, which, that God may bleſs with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and edification, ſhall be my hearty Prayer.</p>

                     <head>PART I.</head>
                     <p>IT has been always reckoned by the beſt and wiſeſt men, a thing ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary towards a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in the World, to begin with the Inſtruction and right Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Children; thoſe of elder Years being ordinarily ſo rooted and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their ſinful habits, that, for the moſt part, there's very little can be done to reform them, and make them better. So ſenſible were ſome ancient States of this, that they made particular Laws for educating Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41019:19"/>
thinking it too great a Truſt, to leave it altogether in the Power of Parents, to train up their Children ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Humour and Fancy. Amongſt Chriſtians, there are few re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints upon Parents; in moſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries it being in their power to Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their Children as they think good: It is therefore of no ſmall importance for them to know what their Duty is, that they may approve themſelves to God, in doing whatever he requires towards their Children, for their Souls, their Bodies, and their outward Eſtate.</p>
                     <p>The deſign of this Treatiſe is, to furniſh thoſe who want ſuch helps with ſome plain and eaſie directions, that they may know how to act the part of Chriſtian Parents.</p>
                     <p>While Children are yet in the Womb,<note place="margin">How Parents ought to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected while Children are yet in the Womb.</note> it is the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Parents to endeavour to bring their mind to an indifferency, as to the Sex which ſhall be born; not to preſcribe to God, by their impatient deſires, and their bold asking of him, a Child of this or that Sex; but to leave it entirely to his Will and Pleaſure, to do what he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41019:19"/>
thinks beſt. The happineſs of Parents does not conſiſt in having Children of this or that Sex: Sometimes Sons (who are moſt deſired ordinarily) may prove uſeleſs in the World, yea very hurtful in many regards; they may occaſion great grief of Heart, and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Anguiſh and Vexation to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, by their mad and fooliſh Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and wicked doings: And on the other hand, Daughters may prove great Bleſſings in the World, great Comforts to their Parents, and great Examples of Piety and of Zeal for the honour of God: On which Accounts Parents ought to reſign their will to God, and be ready with all gratitude to accept whatever he beſtows.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> When a Child is born,<note place="margin">How they ought to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected when their Children are born.</note> Parents ought with all thankfulneſs to return praiſe and thanks to God, who hath beſtowed ſuch a Bleſſing on them, giving them a living Child, ſound and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in all its parts and proportions, without either defect of neceſſary parts, or exceſs and deformity thereof. This ſhould make them admire and adore the Powerful and Wiſe Providence of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41019:20"/>
God, which appears in framing and faſhioning their Infant, ſo curiouſly and wonderfully in the Womb, preſerving it, and making it grow up, from a very ſmall and imperfect beginning, to ſuch a bigneſs, with all thoſe comely ſhapes and proportions which they behold.</p>
                     <p>They ought to look upon their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as given them of God, to be taken care of both as to their Souls and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; to be bred up in his fear, for his Honour and Glory; to be made fit to ſerve him here, and to live with him for ever hereafter.</p>
                     <p>The Soul being the chiefeſt part of the charge committed to Parents, I ſhall firſt ſhew what they ought to do for their Childrens Souls.</p>
                     <div n="1" type="duty">
                        <head>The firſt Duty of Parents for the Souls of their Children, is, to conſecrate them to God in Baptiſm.</head>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> They ought to conſecrate their Children to God in Baptiſm, ſo ſoon as conveniently they can: They cannot better expreſs their gratitude to God for bleſſing them with Children, than by preſenting them to him again in this holy Ordinance; that he may
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41019:20"/>
ſet his Seal upon them, and admit them into his Houſe and Family; that he may beſtow upon them the priviledges of his Children, and give them a Right and Title to the Bleſſedneſs, the Grace and Glory purchaſed by Jeſus Chriſt. It is for this End that Baptiſm is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted; not only to be a Ceremony of Admiſſion into the Church, but to ſeal unto us the pardon of our Sins, to aſſure us of the Divine Favour, to make us Members of Chriſt, Heirs of God, and Inheritours of the Kingdom of Heaven, if we by wilful impeuitency and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, do not afterwards hinder and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the Virtue thereof. It is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for Parents to enquire how ſuch things are done by Baptiſm; it is enough for them to know, That Baptiſm is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for thoſe Ends, and we are ſure that God appoints nothing in vain: Our Saviour is ſaid, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.26. <hi>To ſanctify and cleanſe his Church with the waſhing of water by the Word.</hi> And, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. he is ſaid <hi>to ſave us by the waſhing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And in the 22d. of the <hi>Acts</hi> and 16. it is ſaid by <hi>Ananias</hi> unto <hi>Paul, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe and be baptized, and waſh away thy Sins:</hi> And ſays St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3.21.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41019:21"/>
                           <hi>The like Figure whereunto, even Baptiſm doth now alſo ſave us (not the putting away of the filth of the Fleſh, but the anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God,) by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. <hi>As many of you as have been baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt:</hi> Which words import not only our owning and acknowledging him as the Saviour of the World, who alone is able to waſh and cleanſe us with his Blood, but alſo our profeſſing our reſolution to live holy lives, to walk in newneſs of life according to his Example; in token of which in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church, they who were baptized, were preſently cloathed with White Rayment, to teſtify their reſolution to live in holineſs, and to put off the Old Man, that is, all their former wicked Deeds and Cuſtoms, and filthy Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Likewiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, and 4. it is thus written, <hi>Know ye not that ſo many of us as were baptized into Jeſus Chriſt, were baptized into his Death? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are buried with him by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm into Death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead by the glory of the Father; even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of Life.</hi> Theſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41019:21"/>
words import not only our belief of a crucified Saviour, who dyed and was buried for ſin, to ſave us from it; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo our Repentance, whereby we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ſin, as dead and buried to it for the time to come. The general Deſign of this Sacrament, being ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently plain and clear from theſe and other Scriptures; it is to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, (and oftentimes it proves to very ill purpoſe) to enquire any further as to particulars; for by ſo doing, a great many perſons judging of divine things by their own weak and fooliſh appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, have reaſoned themſelves (if I may ſo ſpeak) both out of their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Religion.</p>

                           <hi>2.</hi> Duty, to ſeaſon their Minds betimes with good Impreſſions.</head>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> When Children begin to ſpeak and to diſcover ſome dawnings of Reaſon, it is fit to ſeaſon their Minds with ſome good Thoughts, with ſome divine Impreſſions, that Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times may catch hold of their tender and innocent Minds, before they are corrupted and defiled with bad Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and vain &amp; unreaſonable Opinions,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41019:22"/>
which they are apt to learn too ſoon from evil Company. Teach them who made them; who dyed for them; for what end they were made; whither good Children go when they dye, and whither naughty Children go; what a place Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is, and Hell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe and ſuch like plain and eaſie things are to be told them, which they can underſtand, and which may make ſome impreſſion on their minds. In teaching Children ſuch matters, it is neceſſary to condeſcend to their weak capacity: It is not fit to ask them ſuch Queſtions at all times, nor yet to ſay too much to them at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one time: Such Inſtructions are to be dropt into their minds ſoftly and leiſurely, ſo as not to oppreſs them, but to recreate them; not to be a burden to them, but a pleaſure. It cannot be expreſſed how great Advantages attend ſuch early Inſtructions; theſe are the Seeds of Virtue, which take root inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, and ſpring up ſometimes very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly; the Impreſſions which they make continue a great while, as Earthen Veſſels retain the ſavour of that Liquor which was firſt put into them a long time after: So powerful are theſe firſt Inſtructions, that they are able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41019:22"/>
even Nature it ſelf. The famous <hi>Lycurgus</hi> made this appear, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Market-place two Dogs of one Litter, and preſenting before them a Pot of Pottage and a Hare; one of them (which was trained up in Hunting) run after the Hare; and the other (which was brought up in the Houſe) fell to the Pottage. What a wonderful power may we daily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in thoſe early impreſſions which are made on mens minds? Thereby it comes to paſs, that the moſt abſurd and extravagant Opinions, which have been ſuck'd in, when one was young, can hardly be removed by the cleareſt and ſtrongeſt Reaſonings.</p>

                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Teach them, ſo ſoon as may be, to pray to God Morning and Evening; To ſay after you, or others whom you appoint for that purpoſe, two or three ſhort Petitions, which are eaſie to be underſtood; and as their Underſtanding and Capacity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth, teach them the Lord's Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and after that ſome larger Form of Prayer, which they may ſay after
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41019:23"/>
you, till they can read it themſelves, or get it by heart.</p>
                        <p>You are to have a ſpecial care, that they perform their Devotions in as grave and ſerious a manner as their years can admit: You are to keep them from all ſorts of indecent Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Poſtures, when they ſay their Prayers: For this end, you are to teach them who it is they ſpeak to when they pray, and what theſe things mean, which they pray for.</p>
                        <p>Chuſe the fitteſt times for them, wherein to ſay their Prayers: as in the Morning, when-ever they ariſe; while their Spirits are moſt vigorous, and their Thoughts moſt free. At Night let them ſay their Prayers rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Supper than after; becauſe after Supper, they are more apt to be very dull and ſleepy, and thereby leſs fit for ſuch a performance. God is not to be ſerved with the refuſe of our thoughts, and with ſluggiſh ſleepy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; but with our beſt and moſt live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affections, and with the ſtrength and fervour of our deſires.</p>
                        <p>You are to prevent their omitting their Prayers at any one time; becauſe doing ſo once or twice, they are apt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41019:23"/>
to neglect them wholly, or to return to them with great averſneſs: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Cuſtom and Conſtancy in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Devotions, will make them much more eaſie and pleaſant to them.</p>
                        <p>When they are poſſeſſed with more perfect and ſolid thoughts about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, with ſtronger and more lively impreſſions of Divine things, and are able without great difficulty to expreſs the ſenſe of their Souls; They may do what they find does ſerve beſt the great purpoſes of Devotion: If praying without reſtraining themſelves to any particular Form of Words, contribute more to their fervency and elevation of mind in Prayer, let them pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out uſing a Form: But if they find that their Minds are more ſtayed and fixed, and their fervency and devotion greater in the uſe of a Form than with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, let them do that which they find beſt.</p>
                        <p>When they pray for outward and temporal things, teach them to do it with an entire ſubmiſſion to the Will of God, who hath promiſed periſhing things conditionally, that is, ſo far as he ſees the beſtowing of them will be for his Glory, and the good of his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41019:24"/>
Children: Therefore they muſt not be vehement and importunate in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and Prayers for ſuch things, but ought to pray for them with great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and reſignation to the Divine Will. As for ſpiritual Bleſſings, to wit, the pardon of Sin, the direction and aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God, his Grace to help them in time of need, power and ſtrength to fight againſt the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe things are to be prayed for with all the importunity and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is poſſible. The more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and fervent their deſires and Prayers are for ſuch things, the more acceptable are they to God, and the more likely to obtain from him the deſires of their Souls; for he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſatisfie the longing Soul with good things.</p>

                        <p>If you find them peeviſh and paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, teach them to be meek and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; to be of a ſweet and mild diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; to love thoſe who have done or ſaid ſomewhat that croſſed them; not to ſeek revenge, but to forgive them, and to be kind to them; to be ready, when they have occaſion, to do them good for evil.</p>
                        <p>If they be given to Lying, ſhew them the evil of it, that a lying Tongue is an abomination to the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.17.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41019:25"/>
the Lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. and 22.15. Shew them how great hurt it will do them, and what ſhame it will bring upon them; That if they be found Lyars, people will not believe them, even when they ſpeak Truth. Encourage them to confeſs their faults, if they have done any thing amiſs; be apt to pardon them when they confeſs, and tell the Truth; and commend them for doing ſo: But if you find them in a Lye, be ſure to chaſtiſe them for it, eſpecially if they have done it oftner than once. Nothing tends more to the ſpoiling of Children, than their getting into ſuch a habit: This is a Vice that grows up apace, if not time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cured by good Education; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they learn to grow ſo falſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuous, that they are not fit to be truſted or employed.</p>
                        <p>If you find them to be of too prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal a Temper, apt to be too profuſe in their Expences; ready to throw away their Money upon Trifles, and when there is no reaſonable occaſion for it; you ought by all prudent and proper Methods to endeavour to make them a little more diſcreet and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41019:25"/>
That they waſte nothing in vain, that may be of uſe to poor people; That they do not throw away that which may do good at ſome time or other. Suggeſt often to them, that we are Stewards of whatever God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows upon us, that he will call us to an account; and that therefore we ought to employ to good purpoſe all thoſe good things he gives us. Shew them what our Saviour ſaid to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, after he had ſed five thouſand men with five Loaves and two Fiſhes, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.12. <hi>When they were filled, he ſaid unto his Diſciples, Gather up the frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that remain, that nothing be loſt.</hi> He would not have any thing loſt, or thrown away unneceſſarily, which might be uſeful afterwards to one or other.</p>
                        <p>If you find them of a covetous Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, endeavour to enlarge their thoughts by the Principles of Chriſtian Charity: Shew them what an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent thing it is to do good; to ſhew mercy and kindneſs; to make peoples hearts glad: Accuſtom them to the doing ſuch kind and charitable offices; for which end, give them now and then money, and other things to beſtow on
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41019:26"/>
thoſe who are poor and needy. Shew them the evil of Covetouſneſs; that it's the root of all evil, that it takes the heart off from God, and rendereth it unfit for the conſideration of Divine things, and for all worthy and uſeful deſigns; that it diſpoſeth a man for the baſeſt and vileſt actions and undertakings, as it did <hi>Judas</hi> to betray his Lord; That it bereaves him of true repoſe and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of mind, and pierceth him through with many ſorrows, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9, 10.</p>
                        <p>If you perceive them to be naturally melancholy, and fearful of every little thing, endeavour to chear up their Spirits: Suggeſt to them ſuch conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and poſſeſs them with ſuch Maxims and Principles, as tend to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie their minds againſt thoſe things which are apt to make them uneaſie, and are the occaſion of their fear. If their diſtemper proceed from ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily indiſpoſition, as oft-times it does, uſe ſuch helps as are neceſſary: When ſuch evil habits of body are once root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſtrongly fixed, and when the blood and ſpirits are deeply infected therewith, they are a very grievous clog to the Soul, and a great hindrance
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41019:26"/>
to that chearfulneſs and liberty of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, wherewith people ought always to endeavour to ſerve God.</p>
                        <p>If you ſee them to be of too gay and airy a Temper, ſo that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fix and be ſtayed at any time, you are to uſe a great deal of prudence and diſcretion to compoſe and ſettle their Spirits; See that they uſe their Wit and Fancy without giving offence, and that they hurt no body by indecent reflections: Let them by no means take liberty to indulge their humour in jeſting about things that are Sacred, or that have any relation thereto: But you are to take heed leſt your endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to cure one fault, occaſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; leſt your ſtriving to deliver them from one extream, drive them to the contrary, that is, leſt inſtead of their being too gay, you make them melancholy and dull: Their Wit and Spirit is not to be rooted out, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and rightly managed; for this may be of uſe for ſeaſoning and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Converſation.</p>
                        <p>If you obſerve them to be raſh and forward, ready to ſpeak and act with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due conſideration; ſtrive to make them more cautious and circumſpect;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41019:27"/>
to reflect and think a little more, on what they ſay and do; leſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, they fall into a habit of ſpeaking and acting impertinently and indiſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: when they ſay or do a fooliſh thing, for lack of conſideration, then take occaſion to make them ſenſible what a ſhame it is for them to do ſo; what a reproach to thoſe who are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Creatures, to ſpeak and act like fools without Reaſon and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: Shew them ſome of the bad conſequences which attend ſpeaking and acting in this manner.</p>
                        <p>Thus you are to make it your Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to conſider what are their defects and faults, and to do all that you can to cure them thereof, and to direct them in the ways of Wiſdom and Virtue.</p>

The Word of God doth teach us all this; <hi>It's given to make us Wiſe to Salvation, that we may make our Calling and our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection ſure;</hi> and therefore neglect not to do this for them, to teach them to read: And when they can do it, cauſe them every day to read more or leſs in that Sacred Book: See that they do it with great Reverence, as being the Word of God: Cauſe them to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der who it is that ſpeaketh to them therein; and what it is that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, promiſes, or threatens; direct
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41019:28"/>
them at firſt to read ſuch places, as are moſt eaſie to be underſtood, and which are apt to make the deepeſt impreſſions: After they have read, ſee what they remember; cauſe them to tell you what they can call to mind: Explain to them ſo far as you are able, what they do not know; eſpecially in ſuch things as are moſt uſeful to make them wiſer and better. Appoint them now and then a verſe or two, to get by heart; cauſe them to repeat them with due gravity; let them not do it in a trifling manner, as if they were telling a ſilly Story.

God, to bleſs the People.

The careful and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous uſe of it, would tye Children more ſtrictly to mind the great concerns of their Souls; it would afford them oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to conſider what it is to have been baptiſed, and to be a Chriſtian: It would work in them a more powerful ſenſe of the Obligations of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and make them more careful to live up to that holy Religion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they made ſo publick a profeſſion: It would make them more afraid to do bad things, againſt which they had proteſted ſo ſolemnly. And not only fear, but ſhame in this caſe, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them from doing wickedly. This
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41019:31"/>

Shall we commit ſuch Villanies, and practice ſuch Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, and thereby break our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Vow and Engagement? Shall we by our folly and impiety give occaſion of offence and ſcandal to the Church of Chriſt, which he hath purchaſed with his Blood? Shall we renounce the Captain of our Salvation, and prove Deſerters, who have ſo lately vowed <hi>to renounce the Devil and all his Works?</hi> What a mighty defence would this be to your Children, when aſſaulted by the fiery Darts of the Devil, the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of the World, and the luſts of their own deceitful hearts; to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that by their own actual Conſent, they have renounced all theſe, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up themſelves into the hands of God, to be kept by his mighty Power,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41019:31"/>
through Faith unto Salvation? They have vowed, and they ought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, to keep his righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

                           <hi>Eighthly,</hi> When they are fit for it, you ſhould encourage them to come to the Table of the Lord, that they may be ſtrengthened in their moſt holy Faith, and further aſſured of the love of God; that they may make a publick profeſſion of their Chriſtianity, of their love to their Lord and Maſter Jeſus, of their Charity to all Men, and of their ſincere affection to thoſe who are Chriſts Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and Followers: They ought to make uſe of this holy Sacrament, that their love to their deareſt Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour may be kindled and enflamed, by remembring his Love, and ſhewing forth his Death; that they may bind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more ſtrictly to ſerve and obey him, and to fulfil their Baptiſmal En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement. How glad ſhould Parents be to ſee their Children advanced to this honour, to eat and drink at their Lord's Table, to partake of ſo great a Teſtimony of his Kindneſs and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? How earneſtly ſhould they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them to embrace this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of renewing their Covenant with
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41019:32"/>
the Lord, to live and to dye his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servants? Do you not deſire to have them ſaved, to have them delivered from their Luſts and Paſſions, their Pride and Revenge, Uncharitableneſs and Malice, their Hatred and Envy, and from all manner of Sin and Folly, to be made pure and clean in Heart and Life, to be made meet for that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly place, where no unclean thing can enter? Do you not deſire that their Sins may be blotted out, that they may be waſhed with the Blood of their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour? And yet do you not adviſe and entreat them for their Souls Health and Safety, to come to the Holy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is deſigned for theſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and great Ends and Purpoſes? But, alas! how far are too many Parents from doing this for their Children? How many do either wholly, or for the moſt part, neglect and ſlight this holy Ordinance themſelves, as if our Lord had without any juſt or neceſſary ground appointed it? How can ſuch Perſons expect the precious Fruits of the Death of Chriſt, who will not remember his Death, when he ſo lovingly and kindly calls and invites them to do it? <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> What a

great Argument is it of a wonderful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of true Piety and Religion in the World, when Men do thus deſpiſe and ſet at naught the kindneſs of their Lord and Saviour? When they refuſe to do a thing, ſo juſt and reaſonable, and ſo eaſie as this is; which tends ſo much to his Glory and their own true Happineſs and Welfare, both here and hereafter?</p>

                        <p>But beſides theſe daily ſhort Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>views of their Heart and Life, 'tis fit to call upon them when they are well advanced in years, to a more ſtrict and ſolemn Examination of themſelves; to Prayer and Faſting, as their Age and Strength can bear it. This may be done once a Month, or once in two Months, or once a Quarter at leaſt. As to their abſtinence from Food on ſuch days, there's no Rule can be given to ſerve all perſons; if they can faſt one meal or two, it is well; if not, then they may eat leſs at a time, and of ſuch things as are leſs apt to be a hinderance to their Devotion: That is to be done that ſerves moſt to render them fit for Prayer and Meditation. It will be convenient in order to their doing this to good purpoſe, to be directed to a method, that ſo their Thoughts may not wander and be unfixed: For which end, it will be of good uſe, to have the direction of their Miniſter, if he be a diſcreet and good Man, or of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prudent ſerious Chriſtian Friend:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41019:34"/>
Or you may recommend to them ſome plain and eaſie ſhort Treatiſe on this Subject, ſuch as you ſhall find written diſcreetly with due moderation of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
                        <p>There is not any one method can be preſcribed for all perſons, nor fit for all times: But in general, upon ſuch days it's fit for them to begin with Prayer to God, humbly begging the Divine Aſſiſtance and Direction; that he may open their eyes to ſee their ſin and folly; and to diſcover his mercy and kindneſs, his long ſuffering and patience towards them, that they may be thereby led to Repentance.</p>
                        <p>They may next enquire particularly and ſtrictly into their ways and doings; which they may do, by conſidering what have been their thoughts, their words and deeds; each of which they are to examine according to the Rule of God's Word: Or, (which comes to the ſame thing) they may go over the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and ſee wherein they have broken any of them: Wherein they find themſelves guilty, they are with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned ſorrow and inward contrition, to confeſs it, to mourn for it, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to beg forgiveneſs of God; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41019:34"/>
with full purpoſe of heart, to do ſo no more; but to ceaſe from evil, and to learn to do well. They are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what Temptations they are moſt in danger of; that they may avoid them: They are alſo to conſider what courſe they muſt take, and what Chriſtian Methods they muſt uſe, to overcome their evil Inclinations, and fooliſh and bad Cuſtoms; and they are to reſolve to govern themſelves accordingly; and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely to endeavour to go on unto perfection. After this, they may reflect on the kind Providences they have met with; that their Souls may be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with a grateful ſenſe thereof; that they may return all praiſe and thanks to God for his mercy and love; and may be excited for the time to come, to truſt more firmly in him, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon him. They may particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly conſider, wherein God hath been pleaſed to anſwer their Prayers, and to grant them the good things they have asked of him for their Souls and Bodies, for themſelves or for others; that their Piety and Love to God may be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the more kindled, and their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion excited; that their Faith and Hope may be made more ſtrong and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>

                           <pb n="34" facs="tcp:41019:35"/>They may take notice likewiſe of the Corrections and Chaſtiſements, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God hath thought fit to exerciſe them; that thereby they may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened from ſin, and made wiſer and better for the time to come.</p>
                        <p>It will be very uſeful for them to have a Note in writing of thoſe vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous particulars; that they may on ſuch days review them, and with the more eaſe make ſuch Reflections on them, as tend to their improvement in real Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                        <p>Beſides theſe Acts of Devotion, which concern themſelves immediately; it will be fit on ſuch days to make earneſt and hearty Prayers to God for all Mankind; for the Converſion of <hi>Jews, Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans:</hi> For the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe Chriſtian Countries that are corrupted with Superſtition and Idolatry; for Union amongſt thoſe that are divided in their Opinions about leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer matters; for deliverance to thoſe who are perſecuted for Righteouſneſs ſake; and for theſe Lands, (that God may inſpire us with a Spirit of Peace, of Love, and of true Piety;) For our King and Queen; for all Judges and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates; for all the Miniſters of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41019:35"/>
Goſpel; for all their Frie nds and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for all their Enemies, and for all who deſire their Prayers; of whom it is not unfit to keep a particular Note in writing, that this Chriſtian Office may be performed towards them with all faithfulneſs and kindneſs.</p>
                        <p>They are next to conſider, what may be done by them for the honour of God and the good of Men; and are to reſolve to do ſome Act or other of Piety or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which may be of real advantage to Mens Souls or Bodies.</p>
                        <p>One thing more I ſhall mention, which may be very uſeful on ſuch days; and that is, That they conſider what are the things wherein they deſire more earneſtly the divine Aſſiſtance and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; which they may write down diſtinctly, that they may renew their Petitions therein every day. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, eſpecially on ſuch days as they appoint for more ſolemn Reflection and Humiliation, they may conſider what Anſwers God has been pleaſed to afford them.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are a few General Heads on this Subject, which may be of great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, in order to the promoting of true Devotion: But the deſigned brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

But to the Conduct of thoſe who not only may be uſeful to advance them in the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41019:38"/>
Knowledge of the World, to aſſiſt them in their Journeyings, to take care about their Lodging and Diet, to wait on them to viſit great Men, to ſee fine Places, curious Fabricks, famous Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents, and ancient Inſcriptions, to learn the Language of the Countrey, and the different Modes and Faſhions, the Government and Policy, and ſuch like: But who likewiſe (through the Bleſſing of God on their Endeavours,) may preſerve them from the Vices of thoſe Countries where they Travel; from thoſe bad Cuſtoms to which they have a great inclination: Who may make it their buſineſs to ſeaſon their Minds with deeper and more lively im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Virtue; to poſſeſs them with a mighty regard for ſuch excellent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples as they have occaſion now and then to ſee, to fortify them againſt the many wicked and dangerous Opinions and Practices they meet with; to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them chiefly with the wiſeſt and beſt Men, by whoſe Converſation they may be improved in Wiſdom and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; that they may return into their own Country with their Minds fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with uſeful Notions, with ſolid Principles, and wiſe Obſervations; that

they may be able, either in a more private way, or in a publick capacity, to do ſomewhat, not unworthy of thoſe who have had ſuch good occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for improving themſelves in thoſe things which are excellent. To ſerve this deſign, Parents are to be careful of two things; One is, That their Children travel under the conduct of one who is wiſe and prudent, and is of a ſincere and ſolid Piety: If he be one that is either fooliſh, or prophane and Atheiſtical, his Company muſt needs be very hurtful and dangerous; It may utterly ruine the young perſons who are intruſted to him. What an unaccountable thing is it to think, that men who are careful to have a skilful Groom to look to their Horſes, ſhould be ſo mad, as to venture their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (who are their chiefeſt Poſſeſſion, and the principal Objects of their care and kindneſs) into the hands of thoſe who have little diſcretion, and leſs pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? The ſecond thing that Parents ought to be careful of, in this matter; is, That their Children do not travel till they are come to ſomewhat of ſtayedneſs, and ſolidity of Judgment; till their underſtanding and diſcretion
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41019:39"/>
is ſuch, as may give ground to hope that their Travelling ſhall do them no hurt, but good. It is none of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt parts in ſome Parents, to ſend their Children too ſoon into Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, before their Judgment is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and made fit to make uſeful Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Obſervations on the World; before their minds are poſſeſſed with ſolid Principles of Virtue, and with a deep ſenſe of Religion; ſo as not to be in great danger from the tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which they are ſure to meet with in moſt places: Before they know any thing at home, it is too ſoon to ſend them abroad: Before they know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a little, it is not adviſable to ſend them into the wide World, to know a vaſt multitude of other things: Hence it too often comes to paſs, that a great many return after their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels greater Fools than they went; they bring back nothing but a load of the Vices and Vanities of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41019:40"/>
in vain attempted their Reformation by milder and gentler Methods: And when you uſe Severity, do it with due moderation, and with great care; leſt you kindle your own paſſion, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the bounds of wiſdom and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If once you give way to this rough, ſevere, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Method of dealing with your Children,<note place="margin">The Evil of too great Severity.</note> there is a threefold diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage attends it; Firſt, you diſcourage your Children, you break their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, you make them unfit for any uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing; you tempt them to do ſuch things as are hurtful to themſelves, and may prove grievous to you. If op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion makes a wiſe man mad; 'tis no wonder if a Child, or young perſon, is ſadly diſordered, and made half mad by cruel and tyrannical uſage: Tho' it be a fault in Children to be ſo; yet Parents ought to be careful not to provoke them over-much to wrath, by a ſevere unmerciful carriage towards them. Secondly, you kindle your own paſſions, you diſorder your minds, and accuſtom your ſelves to a fiery Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; you become fierce, barbarous, and ſavage; thereby you turn one of your

great Temporal Comforts into a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Croſs and heavy Burden. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you hereby likewiſe teach your Children, thorough your Example, to be of a paſſionate and violent Spirit; and ſo you do them more hurt, than all your Corrections and Inſtructions can do them good: Never think to cure them of their Faults, by your committing as bad your ſelves: You muſt not do evil that good may come of it: The wrath of man worketh not the Righteouſneſs of God.</p>

Affliction is the time, in which God uſeth to work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hearts of people moſt powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and effectually; Then he awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, and convinceth them of their

                        <p>'Tis true, 'tis not in the Power of Parents to infuſe good Qualities into the Minds of their Children; ſome are ſo very perverſe, that all that can

Such Parents do often eat the Fruits of their cruel fondneſs, and feel the ſad Effects of their own bad Example, by means of their Prophane and Graceleſs Children.

who, perhaps, are in other reſpects good people; the Lord doth ſometimes pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſuch Parents, and bring Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Judgments upon them. <hi>Ely</hi> was a great inſtance of this, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. and 22.

That you may the better act your part; 'tis fit for you, when you call your ſelves to an account a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout your Lives and Converſations, to make enquiry particularly how you perform the Duties of Parents towards your Children, as to their Souls, their Bodies, and Outward Concerns: And if upon ſerious enquiry, you find that you ſincerely endeavour to do whatever you know your ſelves to be bound to do for them; then bleſs and praiſe God, who gives you both to will and to do according to his good pleaſure: Beg his pardon for thoſe imperfections
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41019:52"/>
and defects that attend all Humane Actions: Reſolve to go on, and not to grow weary in your Duty towards them; that ſo they may be as happy in all reſpects, as is poſſible for you, by the help of God, to make them.</p>
                        <p>But if upon enquiry, you find that you have been very defective in your duty towards your Children; that you have done very little good for their Souls, and not what you ſhould, and might have done for their Bodies and outward Eſtate; and that perhaps you have done them a great deal of hurt by your Evil Counſel, and Prophane and Wretched Example; that you have led them on in the Broad Way, which leads to the Chambers of Death; that you have robbed God, who beſtowed them on you, of their Service and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; and have made them <hi>the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Sin;</hi> that you have contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the making them <hi>Heirs of Wrath, Children of Diſobedience,</hi> who were made by their Baptiſm, <hi>Children of God, and Inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> that you have done what tended to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy eternally thoſe Souls and Bodies, which God intruſted with you, that you might take care of them, and do
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41019:53"/>
what you could to make them happy. If, I ſay, upon enquiry into your hearts and lives, you find your ſelves guilty of thoſe things, how great reaſon have you to be in bitterneſs and grief of Heart, to weep and lament, to abhor your ſelves in Duſt and Aſhes, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and acknowledge your ſins with great humility and contrition, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the divine mercy and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with all earneſtneſs, for the ſake of his dear Son; to reſolve and purpoſe ſincerely to amend your ways and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; to beg grace from God, that he would aſſiſt you, that he would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs you about with his Salvation; and never leave you nor forſake you. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the particular things wherein you have hurt the Souls of your Children, and failed in your Duty to them, as to their Bodies and Outward Concerns: And the more you find you have done amiſs, reſolve ſo much the more to be zealous to do them good; to double your diligence in promoting the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and happineſs both of their Souls and Bodies. Tell them ſo far as is meet, what you now ſee and feel; let them know that you have been out of the way, that you have milled them,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41019:53"/>
and brought both your ſelves and them in danger of being undone, and ruined eternally: Tell them what you reſolve to do, and what you and they ought to do, and muſt do, or elſe that you will certainly periſh. Delay not to do this one moment: fly like a Bird out of the Snare of the Fowler. Your Souls lye at the ſtake, and therefore do what Men uſe to do to ſave their Lives; <hi>Skin for Skin, and all that a Man hath, will he give for his Life.</hi> Men are ready to part with any thing to ſave their lives; They'l part with Houſe and Lands, with Silver and Gold, with their whole Eſtate and Subſtance, to ſave their Bodies alive, which muſt dye at laſt, and, for ought they know, may dye within a very few days or hours. How much more ought you, that you may ſave your own Souls, and the Souls of your Children, to part with your vile and unruly Luſts and Paſſions, your vain fooliſh Habits and Cuſtoms, which are your reproach and diſhonour, which are the worſt things in the World; which can do you no good, if you hold them ſtill, but will certainly do you a great deal of miſchief? They will prove the cauſe of your deſtruction;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41019:54"/>
they will deprive you of all that is good and excellent; they will cut you off from the favour of God, the Love of Chriſt, and the fellowſhip of the Bleſſed Spirit; they will likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive you of the aſſiſtance and Miniſtry of the Holy Angels, and the Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Society of the Saints departed; they will exclude you for ever from the Kingdom of Heaven, the Crown of righteouſneſs, the peace and joy, the love and glory of the future State: All this your ſins will deprive you of; and inſtead thereof, they will expoſe you to the Wrath of God, to the devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring fire, to everlaſting Burnings, to blackneſs of darkneſs, to weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth, to the wretched and curſed company of Devils and damned Souls, to the Worm which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dieth, which will gnaw you, and torment you for ever: And will you chuſe all this rather than part with your Luſts, that you may be for ever happy, and have fulneſs of joy and pleaſures for evermore? Will you be ſo mad, as to prefer Hell and Death, everlaſting Miſery and Woe, to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and everlaſting life, to Bleſſedneſs and Glory? Now is the time for you

                        <p>After all that hath been ſaid, it will not be unfit to add ſomewhat concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Duty of Parents, when God ſees fit to remove their Children from them by Death. This falls out ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often to Parents, that it cannot but be ſeaſonable to a great many to ſuggeſt to them ſome plain and eaſie conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, which they may ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon, and imprint on their minds; that ſo they may not be ſurpriſed with the death of their Children, nor ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up of exceſſive and immoderate grief.</p>

                              <hi>1.</hi> They ought to conſider that it is the Lord who does it.</note> when their Children dye, <hi>firſt,</hi> that is the Lord who does it: He who is Lord of Life, who gave Life to themſelves and to their Children, is alſo Lord of death, and removes out of the World whom, and when, he ſees ſit. He is the great Potter; and Man is the Clay, which he hath formed and faſhioned into a curious and beautiful ſhape; and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated with an immortal Soul: When he ſees fit to break this brittle Veſſel in pieces, and to ſeparate the Soul from it, who dare ſay unto him, What doeſt thou? May not he do with his own, what he thinks good? Or muſt he give an account of his Actions, unto the work of his own hands? He is infinitely great and powerful; and therefore will do according to his own good pleaſure: He is infinitely wiſe, and knows what's beſt and fitteſt to be done. He is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely good and kind, and therefore will order all things for good: And he is infinitely juſt and righteous, and therefore can do no wrong. It's fit therefore that Parents, when God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves their Children from them by
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:41019:56"/>
Death, ſubmit chearfully to the will of him, who is infinitely powerful, wiſe, good, and juſt; and that they adore him, and ſay with <hi>Ely,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.18. <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good.</hi>

                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> They ſhould conſider that their Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren were born Mortal, frail by Nature, ſubject to a neceſſity of dying, by their very compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and frame; and alſo by the Decree of Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. <hi>It is appointed for all Men once to dye.</hi> And therefore when God ſees fit to remove them by Death, to make the Houſe of Clay fall down about their Ears, Parents ought not to be ſurpriſed: This is nothing but what falls out daily: Some are going out of the World, and ſome are coming into it: Some are a great while upon the Stage, and ſome but a very ſhort while; ſome no ſooner enter upon it, but preſently they are gone, and are ſeen no more; ſome take a few turns, and then they are withdrawn; ſome tarry longer, and act a great part on the Stage, for a conſiderable time, and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41019:56"/>
give hopes of yet greater Actions and Performances; but on a ſudden they are gone likewiſe, as a ſhadow; and all their own deſigns and projects, and the hopes and expectations of others fall to the ground. All this happens every day in the Courſe of things here in the World; and therefore Parents have no reaſon to think it ſtrange when they ſee their Children dye. <hi>The thing that hath been, it is that which ſhall be; and that which is done, is that which ſhall be done; and there is no new thing under the Sun,</hi> Eccleſ. 1.9.</p>
                        <p>And as it is with men, ſo it is with all things elſe, which live upon the Earth, or grow out of it: Some live longer and ſome a ſhorter while than others of the ſame kind: Some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper and thrive, and others decay and periſh. Some things grow up in the Morning, and are withered e're Night: Some things grow apace till they are very near the time of ripeneſs and perfection; and then ſomewhat hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth, which prevents the perfect growth, and makes the goodly appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance come to nothing: Now, what are Men? <hi>Moſes</hi> in his Prayer (<hi>Pſ.</hi> 90.5, 6.) tells us, <hi>In the Morning they are like

graſs, which groweth up; In the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it flouriſheth and groweth up: In the Evening it is cut down and wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe the Pſalmiſt <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.15, 16, <hi>As for Man his days are as graſs, as a flower of the field, ſo he flouriſheth, for the Wind paſſeth over it, and it is gone, and the place thereof ſhall know it no more.</hi> Likewiſe <hi>Eſa.</hi> 40.6, 7. it is thus written, <hi>The Voice ſaid Cry. And he ſaid What ſhall I cry? All fleſh is graſs, and all the goodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof is as the flower of the field. The graſs withereth, the flower fadeth, becauſe the Spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it: Surely the people is graſs.</hi> By all which it appears what Man is by Nature, to wit, a very weak and vaniſhing thing, ſoon nipt and brought to nothing; like the tender Graſs and the Flower of the Field, which is more expoſed to the Winds and other inconveniencies, than the Flowers of the Garden, which the Gardiner preſerves and ſecures.</p>
                        <p>The Conſideration of theſe things will tend mightily to quiet the minds of thoſe who calmly and wiſely reflect upon them, when God removes their

Children, or other Relations from them by Death. Their caſe is not ſingular, it is that which is common and uſual amongſt men; it is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the courſe of Nature for a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal thing to die.</p>
                        <p>But what if the manner of the death of your Children be ſomewhat extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, by ſome ſudden and unuſual Accident, or by ſome ſtrange and odd Diſtemper; are you on this account to allow your ſelves in the exceſſes of Sorrow and Mourning? No, in no ways: You are not therefore to be tranſported into immoderate grief and mourning. Shall you be vexed and diſquieted, becauſe a Worm did eat up your pleaſant Fruit, or becauſe the ſtormy Wind did blow away your love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Flowers? Are you therefore to be enraged and mad with anger againſt the Worms, or againſt the Winds? What would it mend the matter, if you ſhould give way to your paſſion and anger never ſo much in ſuch a caſe? This would only multiply your loſſes, by making you loſe not only your Fruit and your Flowers, but your ſelves too: Which they all do, who loſe their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, in which it is that we poſſeſs our Souls.</p>

They were here in a life of Vexation and Trouble; ſubject to innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable vanities, tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſnares and dangers: They were compaſſed about with great and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Enemies, the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh: They were ſubject to daily neceſſities and wants. If they had lived never ſo long, they would only have ſeen the ſame things in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ſucceſſion and revolution: As for Example, heat and cold, fair wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and foul, night and day, Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and Winter, health and ſickneſs, plenty and poverty, peace and war, proſperity and adverſity, ſucceeding one to another: All things going round. But now they are delivered from all theſe; they are at reſt, they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to no more neceſſities and wants; oppreſſed with no more troubles and vexations; expoſed to no more ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,

temptations or dangers; but exalted to a ſtate of perfect peace, joy, love, and glory. They are as well and better than you can deſire: You are not able to comprehend the Happineſs that they are admitted to. Will you then be in continual ſorrow and grief for your Children, when they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted to a ſtate of Reſt and Glory; when they are where you would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce to be; when their gracious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath freed them from the vain company of the World, and tranſlated them into the bleſſed Society of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and of the Spirits of juſt men made perfect; when he hath put an end to their toil and labour, to their fighting and wreſtling againſt their Enemies, and beſtowed on them a Crown of Glory, and an everlaſting Inheritance; when he hath broken their bonds aſunder, wherein they were held and kept in captivity and ſlavery, and hath put them into a ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and glorious freedom? The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of theſe things ſhould miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and aſſwage your ſorrow and grief, and fill you with unſpeakable comfort and gladneſs.</p>

If your Children, while they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, minded good things; and if you did your part to inſtruct them, and to make them what God requires them to be, you are not to be any further ſolicitous about their everlaſting ſtate: You are to hope that they are very happy, and you are to comfort your ſelves with theſe thoughts.</p>

As to ſuch Parents, who have had wretched Children, they ought not to ſuffer their minds to be diſordered, and oppreſſed with grief and ſorrow, becauſe their Children, who died, were wicked. If they did their Duty to make

them better; if they adviſed and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed them; if they reproved them, and, as was fitting, chaſtened them; if they deſired others to deal with them, to ſee what they could do towards the reclaiming of them; if they prayed to God for them, and gave them a good Example: they are not any further to be troubled and diſquieted concerning them, when God takes them into his own hand; He is wiſe and good, holy and juſt, he does all things well, for excellent and glorious ends; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Parents ought to leave them to his Diſpoſal, who is the Supreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the World, and Judge of the whole Earth. Whatever he does, whether in Mercy or Juſtice, is always beſt. The Inhabitants of the other World, who are tranſlated into a ſtate of heavenly Glory, are not under the power of ſuch paſſions and partialities, as govern us here below. The glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Parents of damned Children, are not under any uneaſineſs on that or any other account: The Will of God and his Glory is their all; they know that whatever he does is moſt perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſt and good, and for his honour; and therefore all things afford them
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41019:60"/>
great pleaſure and delight, true and laſting joy and ſatisfaction of mind. There's nothing able to interrupt the happineſs and joy of thoſe in Glory: They are perfectly and eternally deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from all ſort of evils, both of ſin and puniſhment: They are placed above the reach of whatever may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them in the leaſt uneaſie.</p>
                        <p>But there is a third ſort; of thoſe who are troubled, not only becauſe their Children were bad and prophane, but becauſe they were ſo through their example or neglect. As for ſuch, I have already in general ſhewed them what they ought to do. I ſhall only add; That ſince they have been ſo faulty and defective in their Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their deceaſed Children, they ought to be the more careful of thoſe who are yet alive, and to do all that is poſſible to make them what God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires them to be. As to thoſe who have no more Children left them, it would be very fit for them to take into their care one or more Children, upon whom they may beſtow all that pains &amp; care which they ſhould have beſtowed in the right Education of their own; and endeavour, by God's help, to make
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41019:61"/>
them truly pious and religious, and Patterns of all ſorts of Virtue to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. This is an office which will be very acceptable to God, and one of the beſt demonſtrations which Parents can make of the ſincerity of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, for their not having done their Duty to their own Children.</p>

The mighty Power of God, which made all things cut of nothing, will alſo gather together the ſcattered duſt of thoſe who are deceaſed, and will reform and rebuild, as it were, their bodies which are fallen down, and conſumed.

You likewiſe do unſpeakable miſchief to your Souls; you deprive your ſelves of that vigour and chearfulneſs of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that is needful to make you fit to ſerve God acceptably.

                        <p>Your Example does alſo a great deal of hurt to others: Your impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and immoderate ſorrow and mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning teacheth others to do ſo upon the like occaſion. Hereby you bring no ſmall reproach upon our holy Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

as if it were not ſufficient to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and fortifie us againſt our croſſes and afflictions, and to comfort us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the uneaſie things which God ſees ſit to exerciſe us with in this World.</p>
                        <p>What an excellent Example is <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> unto you in this matter? When God ſtruck his Child, ſo that it was very ſick, he faſted and prayed; but when the Child died, he <hi>aroſe from the earth, and waſhed and anointed himſelf, and changed his apparel, and came unto the Houſe of the Lord, and worſhipped: Then he came to his own houſe; and when he required, they ſet bread before him, and he did eat. Then ſaid his ſervants unto him, What thing is this that thou haſt done? Thou didſt faſt and weep for the Child, while it was alive; but when the Child was dead, thou didſt riſe and eat bread. And he ſaid, While the Child was yet alive, I faſted and wept; for I ſaid, Who can tell, whether God will be gracious unto me, that the Child may live? But now he is dead, Wherefore ſhould I faſt? Can I bring him again? I ſhall go to him, but he ſhall not return to me,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.15, 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus ought all Parents to do, who
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41019:63"/>
fear God. When the Lord layeth his hand upon your Children, you ought to pray to God for them, and to uſe all lawful means for their recovery: But when he ſees fit to take them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by death, you ought patiently to ſubmit to his Will, and to ſay with <hi>Job: The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; bleſſed be the name of the Lord,</hi> Job 1.21. This is your wiſeſt courſe: It is the way to make your ſelves happy, and to enjoy comfort and ſatisfaction of mind under your croſſes. This is the likelieſt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt way to obtain new Mercies and Favours from the Lord, inſtead of thoſe you are deprived of: Thus you ſee the Lord dealt with <hi>Job: Jam.</hi> 5. 11. <hi>Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have ſeen the end of the Lord: That the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> And <hi>Job</hi> 42.12, 13. <hi>The Lord bleſſed the latter end of Job, more than his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi> And <hi>verſ.</hi> 16, 17. <hi>After this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Job an hundred and forty years, and ſaw his ſons, and his ſons ſons, even four generations. So Job dyed, being old and full of days.</hi>
                        </p>

                  <p>THERE is ſcarce any thing wherein all Nations, and Men of all Religions, do more agree, than in the Common Duties of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to their Parents: Neither is there any thing that tends more to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and happineſs, the beauty and ſtrength of Society, than for Children to perform all thoſe Duties which they owe to their Parents. And yet hew ſad is it to think, that a great many Children, who have not only all the advantages which natural Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on affords, but likewiſe the aſſiſtance of Divine Revelation, do nevertheleſs
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:41019:70"/>
carry themſelves in that manner to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Parents, as if they either underſtood nothing of their Duty, or were moſt prodigiouſly perverſe, and reſolved to rebel againſt the Light, to trample upon all the Principles both of Natural and Revealed Religion.</p>
                  <p>The Deſign of this ſhort Treatiſe is to ſhew what the Duties of Children are towards their Parents, and to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt ſome Conſiderations to excite them to do their Duty.</p>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:41019:70"/>
and honour their perſons: And if at any time diſreſpectful and irreverend thoughts ariſe in their minds, they ought to check them, to accuſe and be angry with themſelves for them; and to call to mind what God hath commanded them to do, when he ſaith, <hi>[Honour thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.]</hi>

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> This imports that they ought to expreſs their inward Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Eſteem by all the outward marks and demonſtrations thereof, in their words and deeds, their looks and geſtures; theſe things are the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Mind, they ordinarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the temper and diſpoſition thereof; ſo that if there be any thing of real eſteem and regard towards any body in the heart, it will diſcover it ſelf by ſome of thoſe outward expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. We ſee how <hi>Solomon</hi> carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf towards his Mother, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.19. <hi>Bathſheba went unto King Solomon to ſpeak unto him for Adonijah: And the King roſe up to meet her, and bowed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto her, and ſate down on his Throne, and cauſed a ſeat to be ſet for the King's Mother, and ſhe ſate on his right hand.</hi>

Children are more apt to carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves irreverently and ſlightingly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Mother, which is the reaſon, as ſome think, that ſhe is ſet down firſt. Lev. 19.3. <hi>Ye ſhall fear every man his mother, and his father.</hi>

                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This imports that they ought to cover the infirmities and weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the imperfections and indiſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Parents; to do as <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Japhet</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.23. when <hi>Noah</hi> their Father was drunken, and was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered within his Tent. <hi>They took a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and laid it upon both their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and went backwards, and covered the nakedneſs of their father, and their faces were backward, and they ſaw not their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers nakedneſs.</hi> Children are not to publiſh the faults and follies of their Parents; but ought to conceal them, all that they can. However, there are two things very conſiſtent with this Duty: Firſt, Children may and ought to do all that they can, by their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, modeſt, and humble Advice, to reclaim their Parents from their ſinful practices. Secondly, If they find it not ſo fit for them immediately to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe their Parents; or if what they ſay hath not the deſigned effect, then
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41019:71"/>
they may recommend this charitable office to the care of ſome other body, who is a wiſe and kind, a pious and ſerious Friend, who may have ſome more influence than themſelves towards the reclaiming their Parents. This is the greateſt expreſſion of true kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, honour, and reſpect to them, when their Children ſincerely endeavour, in the diſcreeteſt manner, to be the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py inſtruments of their Converſion and Reformation; of turning them from Satan unto God: This is to be, in ſome ſort, the Fathers in Chriſt, to thoſe who are their Parents by Nature. O how happy are the Parents of ſuch worthy Children! How may they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and bleſs God, who hath beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on them ſo great a Bleſſing?</p>
                     <p>If Children are thus obliged to honour their Parents;<note place="margin">Againſt thoſe who diſhonour their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</note> what ſhall be ſaid of thoſe who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, deſpiſe, and ſlight them, all that ever they can; who undervalue them in their thoughts; who ſpeak of them with great contempt and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain; who ſpeak to them with great inſolence; who mock and ſcorn them; who laugh at them, and make mouths
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41019:72"/>
at them, and point at them with the finger; who reproach and revile them; who break indecent jeſts upon them; who make them the objects of their ſport and paſtime; who take pleaſure in publiſhing their weakneſſes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretions, that others alſo may laugh at them, and deſpiſe them? How dreadful and terrible are the Curſes and Judgments, which God hath in ſtore againſt ſuch wretched Children? Prov. 30.17. <hi>The eye that mocketh at his father, and deſpiſeth to obey his mother; the Ravens of the vallies ſhall pick it out, and the young Eagles ſhall eat it.</hi> That is, he who is a mocker and ſcorner of his Parents, who deſpiſes and ſlights them, ſhall die a ſhameful death, and remain unburied, and ſhall be expoſed to the birds and beaſts of prey, to be eaten of them. It does not follow from hence, that all perverſe wretched Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren come to ſuch a ſhameful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely end: Only it ſhews what oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happeneth, and is very uſual, to wit, that ſuch mockers and deſpiſers of Parents are puniſhed remarkably by the Juſtice of God in this World, and are made Examples to all others, who will open their eyes to conſider the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41019:72"/>
hand of God againſt ſuch ungodly Children.</p>
                     <p>As for Inſtances of the Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice againſt Mockers of Parents, all Ages and Countries are full of them. <hi>Cham</hi> was made an Example of this, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.22, 24, 25. <hi>And Cham the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Canaan ſaw the nakedneſs of his father, and told his two brethren without. And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger ſon had done unto him. And he ſaid, Curſed be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan; a ſervant of ſervants ſhall he be unto his brethren.</hi> In which words, tho' <hi>Canaan</hi> the Son of <hi>Cham</hi> is only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, yet <hi>Cham</hi> is not exempted from the Curſe; his puniſhment is hereby made ſo much the greater, becauſe he is not only pronounced accurſed in his own perſon (which is neceſſarily to be ſuppoſed, he having committed the ſin which cauſed the Curſe) but alſo in his Poſterity, which could not but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe mightily his grief, and make his puniſhment lye more heavy upon him.</p>

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Children are to obey their Parents, to do what they bid them.

Come, and I will ſend thee unto them: And he ſaid to him, Here am I. And he ſaid to him, Go, I pray thee, ſee whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks, and bring me word again: ſo he ſent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.</hi> The Commands of Parents are either about the ſame things which God hath commanded, or they are about things indifferent, or about things unlawful. If they are about the ſame things which God hath commanded, they are ſo much the more to be obeyed; as being the will and pleaſure both of their Father in Heaven, and of their earthly Parents. In this caſe the obligation to obedience is double. Secondly, If their Parents Commands are about things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that is, which are neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41019:73"/>
nor forbidden by God, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are likewiſe to obey them: God hath made it their Duty ſo to do, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Children obey your Parents in all things; for this is well pleaſing unto the Lord.</hi> This obedience is very accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to him; he takes great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and delight in it, to ſee thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed and ſubmitted to, whom he hath appointed to be, as it were, in his own ſtead; whom he hath cloathed with ſome beams of Divine Power; whom, with relation to their Children, he hath made, in ſome ſenſe, ſacred perſons; whoſe Will ought to be a Law unto them, tho' only in the Lord. For, Thirdly, if the thing command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be plainly unlawful, they are to refuſe complacence therewith; becauſe they are bound to obey God rather than man, rather than Father or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; rather than all the World: Their obligations to God are much greater than to their Parents; he is the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker both of them, and of their Parents; they live by his Bounty, the Earth they tread on is his; the Air they breathe in, the Heavens that cover them, the food they eat, the water they drink, the garments that cloath them, and all
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41019:74"/>
other things which they enjoy for their benefit and comfort in the World, are the Lord's: He is their great Maſter, who appoints them their buſineſs in the World, and aſſures them of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; he alſo will reckon with them, and either reward, or puniſh them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their works; and therefore his Commands are to be preferred to thoſe of all others.</p>
                     <p>But even in this caſe, Children are to expreſs, in their very denial and refuſal of obedience, all that Honour and Reſpect to their Parents, that's poſſible; that they may ſee it is not ſtubbornneſs, but the fear of God, which makes them diſobey. By this means Parents may perhaps be convinced, and made ſenſible of their ſin, and prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with to ſhun thoſe evil things, which they ſee their very Children do ſo much hate and abhor, and wherein they refuſe to obey.</p>

who will not follow their Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and be governed by them for their own good; but do follow their own humor &amp; fancy, and the examples and cuſtoms of others like themſelves? What a ſad mark is this of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ruine, and of heavy Judgments, which hang over the heads of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Children, as you may ſee in the Sons of <hi>Ely,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.25. of whom it is ſaid, that <hi>they hearkened not unto the voice of their Father, becauſe the Lord would ſlay them.</hi>

                     <p>By the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the ſtubborn Son was to be put to death, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.18, 19, 20, 21. <hi>If a man have a ſtubborn and rebellious ſon, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that when they have chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, will not hearken unto them: Then ſhall his father and mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the Elders of his City, and unto the gate of his place: And they ſhall ſay unto the Elders of his City, This our ſon is ſtubborn and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious, he will not obey our voice: He is a glutton and a drunkard.

To give themſelves away, without their Parents Conſent, is a kind of theft; it is to invade the right of others; to rob them of that which
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41019:77"/>
God hath given them. We ſee how great the Power of Parents was, by the Law of <hi>Moſes, Numb.</hi> 30.3, 4, 5. To diſanul the raſh Vows of their Children before Marriage. <hi>If a Woman alſo vow a Vow unto the Lord, and bind her ſelf by a Bond, being in her Father's Houſe, in her youth, and her Father hear her Vow and her Bond, wherewith ſhe hath bound her Soul, and her Father ſhall hold his peace at her: Then all her Vows ſhall ſtand, and every Bond wherewith ſhe hath bound her Soul, ſhall ſtand: But if her Father diſallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her Vows, or of her Bonds, wherewith ſhe hath bound her Soul, ſhall ſtand: And the Lord ſhall forgive her, becauſe her Father diſallowed her.</hi> Now if it be thus in a Father's power to diſanul his Daughters raſh Vow which ſhe made to God, how much more may we reckon it in his Power, to diſanul her raſh and indiſcreet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to Man, of beſtowing her ſelf without her Parents allowance? Can there be any thing more unjuſt, more unkind, more unthankful, and more unnatural, than for Children, who have been brought up, nouriſhed, and cheriſhed by their Parents, for
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41019:78"/>

                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Children ought to love their Parents; and to expreſs it by all thoſe Offices, which are in their Power to do for them; by ſerving them readily; by doing every thing that may make them well pleaſed; by ſympathizing with them in all their troubles; by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting them, and doing all they can, to make their Lives joyful and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable; by ſhunning every thing that may grieve them, or make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie: They ought to refuſe no labour, nor pains to do them ſervice, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when they are ſick and weak, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with the Burden of Old Age, or poor and indigent, under any ſort of neceſſity whatſoever; then ought Children to be very ready to help them, to comfort and to encourage them, to do all that they can to make their lives eaſie to them, and to ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten their Burdens. This is called, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.4. <hi>A ſhewing Piety at home.</hi> It is an act of Religion and Worſhip, which God is well pleaſed with. We ſee how <hi>Joſeph</hi> nouriſhed his Father and his

                     </p>
                     <p>How many Examples have there been amongſt the Heathens of Eminent Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards Parents? Such was that Act of her,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Valer. Max.</hi> l. 5. cap. 4.</note> who when her Old Father was condemned to be put to death in Priſon, viſited him often, and gave him ſuck, and ſo preſerved him alive, who otherwiſe muſt have dyed of Famine.</p>
                     <p>The like inſtance we meet with in the ſame Author,<note place="margin">Valer. Max. ibid.</note> of a worthy Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Daughter, who did in the ſame manner preſerve her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Priſon, being condemned to dye. When the Keeper of the Priſon, to whom the charge of putting her to death was committed, found after ſome time, that her Daughter kept her alive by giving her ſuck, he was ſo affected with the greatneſs of the Daughters Compaſſion and tenderneſs to her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he made it known to thoſe in Power, who were likewiſe ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily touched with ſuch an unuſual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41019:81"/>
of tender Affection; that they pardoned the Mother, as the greateſt Reward they could beſtow on the Daughter for her marvellous Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                     <p>What can there be more juſt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, than for Children thus to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to requite their Parents, for their great care and kindneſs towards them, when they were not able to help themſelves? The time was, when their Parents were as Eyes and Hands and Feet to them; they did every thing for them, their Children not being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to do any thing for themſelves: How ready therefore ſhould they be to ſerve their Parents, to aſſiſt them by all good Offices, when their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on requires it?</p>
                     <p>This is a Duty to which Children are ſo ſtrictly obliged (to wit the aſſiſting and relieving of their Parents) that no pretence is ſufficient to abſolve them from the Obligation thereof. The <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> thought they had found out an Exception from this Rule, which was this; that if Children gave away their Wealth to pious and Charitable uſes, they were freed from the Obligation of relieving their Parents: They taught
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:41019:81"/>
them in this caſe, to tell their Parents, <hi>It is Corban, that is to ſay, a Gift, by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou mighteſt be profited by me.</hi> Mar. 7.11. And by ſaying this, they made people believe that they were ſufficiently freed from all Obligations to take care of, and provide for their Parents. But our Saviour reproves them ſeverely, telling them, that this was no other than the <hi>making void the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God by their Traditions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We may ſee from this,<note place="margin">Againſt unkind and unnatural Children.</note> what Judgment to make of ſuch unkind, undutiful, and unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Children, who do wholly neglect their Parents, eſpecially in their old age, and in their poor and low Eſtate; who ſhew them no more pity, and expreſs no more love nor tenderneſs towards them, than if they were not their Parents; who grudge them the leaſt ſupply; and take all the wicked courſes that they can, to ſtarve them to death, that they may be rid of them; who wiſh and long for, and rejoyce in the death of their poor Parents. O what a horrid Barbarity and Inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is this! Shall not many Pagans riſe up in Judgment againſt ſuch Children, and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:41019:82"/>
Condemn them? How little do they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Name of Chriſtian Children? Their true Name is Unchriſtian, and unnatural Children. As <hi>Solomon</hi> bid the Sluggard <hi>go to the Ant,</hi> ſo may we bid ſuch hard-hearted and unmerciful Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren go to the Stork, of whom it is told, that when the old Dams cannot feed themſelves, their little ones feed and nouriſh them; when their Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers fall from them, they cover them with their Feathers; and when they are not able to fly, they couple them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together, to carry them upon their Backs. Let uncompaſſionate Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren go to this compaſſionate Creature, and conſider her ways and be wiſe; Let them learn from her, to be more kind and affectionate, and tender-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted towards their Parents, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer to harden their Bowels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>

                        <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Becauſe all that Children can do is not ſufficient to requite the love and tender care of their Parents; therefore they ought to pray to God, that he would reward them, and preſerve
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:41019:82"/>
them, and keep them alive; that he would ſupply all their wants, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them in all their troubles, and requite their Love, their tender care, and their great coſt and pains they have been at to bring them up, and to edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them. How happy are the Parents of ſuch Children, who are ſupplicants and interceſſors, at the Throne of Grace, for good things unto them?

                     <p>If it be the Duty of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, thus to pray to God,<note place="margin">Againſt Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</note> in behalf of their Parents, what ſhall we ſay of thoſe, who neither pray for them, nor them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but live like the Beaſts that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and mind nothing that's good? And if their Crime is great, who do not at all pray for their Parents; how dreadful is their Guilt, who Curſe them? What dreadful Judgments may ſuch Monſters of wickedneſs expect. <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.20. <hi>Who ſo Curſeth his Father or his Mother, his Lamp ſhall be put out in obſcure darkneſs;</hi> that is, he ſhall be reduced unto a ſad afflicted and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable State; his proſperous condition

(which is compared to Light, or to a Lamp) ſhall be turned into Adverſity and Miſery, and that very great, which is expreſſed by <hi>[obſcure darkneſs]</hi> he ſhall be made very miſerable; his ſtate and condition in the World ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come moſt uncomfortable; as it is for a Man who walketh in a way that is full of Light, where he beholds a great many Objects, which afford him plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and delight, ſuddenly to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of all this, and to find himſelf all alone in obſcure darkneſs, without all help and comfort.

                     <p>From what hath been ſaid, Children may ſee what their Duty is, which they owe to their Parents; which that they may perform, there are ſeveral things which ſerve as powerful Motives and Arguments to excite them.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Motive, from the divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</note> It will tend migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to move them to <hi>Honour their Father and Mother,</hi> if they conſider who requires this at their hands. This Law proceedeth not from Men, but from God; It is a Law made by him who is their Maker; and therefore by right of Creation may require their Obedience: It is a Law made by their faithful preſerver, and rich pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vider; and therefore by vertue of his daily care over them, and kindneſs to them, may command them what he thinks good: This is the will of their Father in Heaven, of their Lord and King, of him who will call them to an account, <hi>and render to them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Works;</hi> of him who is their greateſt and beſt Friend, if they <hi>do his Will and keep his Commandments;</hi> but will be their moſt dreadful and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Enemy, if they do not obey his Voice: If therefore children have any ſenſe of God on their Souls; if they conſider his infinite greatneſs, power,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:41019:84"/>
wiſdom, juſtice, truth, faithfulneſs, mercy, and kindneſs; they cannot but endeavour to perform what he requires, when once they know what is his holy will and pleaſure. Now, as to what I ſpeak of, to wit the Duty of Children to Parents, it is plain and clear, not only from thoſe Laws which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Holy Scripture, which were revealed from Heaven to Holy Men, whom God made uſe of to be the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhers thereof to the World: but likewiſe from the Laws of Nature, thoſe clear impreſſions which God hath made on the minds of Men in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and in all Ages; whereby they are taught that Children ought to honour and obey their Parents, to love them and to relieve them, and provide for them, if they ſtand in need of their help. Theſe have always been the calm and ſober thoughts of all Men; and when any were ſo wicked as to violate this ſacred Law, they were hated and abhorred by all others; and in all well govern'd States, were puniſhed according to the demerits of their Crime, and the degree of their diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and perverſeneſs, either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by the Parents, or by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:41019:84"/>
Judges, upon complaint made by Parents. The Senſe of all this ought to move Children to honour their Father and Mother, that they may approve themſelves to God, who requires them to do ſo, and that upon the ſevereſt Penalties, if they ſhall dare to diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them, and diſobey them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> To encourage Children to perform their Duty to their Parents,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>2.</hi> Motive, from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Promiſe.</note> God hath been pleaſed to add a gracious promiſe. <hi>That thy days may be long upon the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</hi> He might only have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to do this, by virtue of his abſolute Power and Soveraign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which he has over all Men, without propoſing any Reward; but ſuch is his infinite Bounty and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that he hath added a Promiſe to the Command, thereby to make Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Duty the more eaſie.</p>
                     <p>As to the Promiſe it ſelf, it is not to be underſtood abſolutely, as if all good Children ſhould live long; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Temporal Bleſſings are made conditionally, that is, ſo far as God ſees ſuch things beſt and fitteſt for us: So that as to this promiſe of long life,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:41019:85"/>
God will beſtow it, if it be moſt for his own Glory, and the good and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Children. Oftentimes he does lengthen out the years of pious and dutiful Children; whereas the years of wicked and undutiful Children are ſhortned by their prophane and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Courſes; ſo that ſome of them are cut off immediately by the hand of God; and others are put to death by the hand of Man.</p>
                     <p>As for thoſe Children who live not to a great Age, tho' they are very du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and obedient to their Parents; God doth make up what is wanting in the number of their years here, with an everlaſting Life, and Glory in Heaven. In which caſe there's no cauſe to Complain, as if God did not fulfill his promiſe to them. For as there is no reaſon for a Man to complain, who is employed to work for ſo much a day, if his Maſter ſee it fit to free him from his Work, and pay him all his Wages before the third part of his time is out: Even ſo, if God think fit to ſet his Children at Liberty, from the toil and labour of this life, and to beſtow upon them glorious and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Rewards, while they are in the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:41019:85"/>
Morning or Noon, as it were, of their Age, there is no ground of complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his doing ſo, but rather great matter of praiſe and thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unto him, whoſe mercy and love is infinitely great.</p>
                     <p>But beſides this Reward in the other World; there are Temporal Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which God will beſtow on thoſe who keep this Commandment. How acceptable and pleaſing to him, was the Obedience of the <hi>Rechabites</hi> unto their Father, tho' his Commands ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very hard and ſevere, to wit, <hi>That they ſhould drink no Wine, nor build Houſe, nor ſow ſeed, nor plant Vineyard, nor have any, but ſhould dwell in Tents,</hi> Jer. 35. 6, 7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ver. 18. <hi>Jeremiah ſaid unto the Houſe of the</hi> Rechabites, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, the God of Iſrael, becauſe you have obeyed the Command of</hi> Jonadab <hi>your Father, and kept all his Precepts, and done according to all that he hath commanded you: Therefore thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, the God of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> Jonadab <hi>the Son of</hi> Rechab <hi>ſhall not want a Man to ſtand before me for ever.</hi> Which Words import that he would take a particular care of them, that he would be mindful of them, and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:41019:86"/>
have them in his Eye; that he would preſerve them, and ſhew them his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and love, and continue unto them thoſe Offices and Priviledges which they enjoyed, which ſome think were, of being Scribes and Doctors of the Law, and having ſome Charge in or about the Temple.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>3.</hi> Motive, from the Example of our Bleſſed Saviour.</note>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Beſides the Command of God, and the Reward which he hath promiſed to them who honour their Parents, how ſtrong an Argument ought it to be unto all Children, to excite them to this, when they conſider the Example of their Bleſſed Lord and Maſter, their King and Saviour, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> Of whom it is ſaid, <hi>that he was ſubject unto his Parents, Luke</hi> 2.51 And if he, who was ſo much greater than his Parents, who was their Lord, their King, their Maker, their Saviour and Redeemer; if he, who was the Son of God, and thought it no Robbery to be equal with God, I ſay, if he was ſubject to his Parents, ought not all Children to be ſo to their Parents? and to eſteem it their glory to imitate their Prince and Saviour, as in his other Virtues,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:41019:86"/>
ſo in his Obedience and Subjection to his Parents? Shall any Man think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf too good to do this, when Chriſt did it before him? Can it be too mean for a Worm to do that, which a Man, a great Man, and a mighty Prince hath done? Shall vile ſinners think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves abaſed and diſhonoured by doing that which was done before by him, <hi>who knew no ſin, and in whoſe Mouth there was found no guile,</hi> who was <hi>holy, harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and undefiled, ſeparate from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and made higher than the Heavens, Heb.</hi> 7.26. As our Bleſſed Lord was a great and noble Pattern to us in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, ſo particularly in his love to his Parents. When he was upon the Croſs, a little before he gave up the Ghoſt, he expreſſed how great his love was to his Mother, and how tender a care he had of her. John 19.25, 26, 27. <hi>Now there ſtood by the Croſs of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, his Mother, and his Mothers Siſter,</hi> Mary <hi>the Wife of</hi> Cleophas, <hi>and</hi> Mary Magdalene. <hi>When Jeſus therefore ſaw his Mother, and the Diſciple ſtanding by, whom he loved, he ſaith unto his Mother, Woman, behold thy Son. Then ſaith he to the Diſciple, behold thy Mother. And from that hour, that Diſciple took her unto his
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:41019:87"/>
own home.</hi> He commends his Mother to <hi>John (Joſeph</hi> in all probability being dead) that he might take care of her, as of his own Mother. Tho' he was at this time in the midſt of great pain and anguiſh, tho' his hands and his feet were nailed to the Croſs, tho' his head was Crowned with Thorns, tho' he lay under the moſt inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Burden that ever Man lay under, yet, as if the ſight of his Mother had made him forget all his Sufferings, and Torments, he affectionately recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends her to the Care of another, who he knew would perform all the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a loving Son unto her. He knew how great an affliction it would be to her, to be deprived of the Comfort of his preſence in the World; he knew to how many neceſſities and wants, ſhe ſhould be expoſed by his leaving of her; and therefore he gives it in charge to the beloved Diſciple, to do the Duty of a Son unto her, to be to her in his ſtead, to honour her, to love her, to ſerve her, to take care of her, and provide whatever might be fit for her. This ſhews all Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren what is their Duty towards their Parents, to wit, that they ought to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:41019:87"/>
take care of them, ſo long as they live, and are able to do it; they ought with all reſpect and kindneſs, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form unto them all thoſe Offices, which the Laws of Nature and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity require.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> May not the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of ſome Heathens,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>4.</hi> Motive, from the Examples of ſome Heathens.</note> which have already been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, excite Chriſtian Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to perform their Duty to their Parents? There are a great many more inſtances might be added to this purpoſe; I ſhall only mention two. The firſt is, of the brave <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> that Great <hi>Roman</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, who being very ill uſed by his Country-men, fled to the <hi>Volſcians,</hi> who were at that time at War with the <hi>Romans.</hi> Within a little time after his coming amongſt them, he was made General of their Forces; in which Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he had great Succeſs againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> gaining ſeveral Victories over them, whereby he was encouraged to approach to the very Walls of <hi>Rome:</hi> His Country-men were terribly alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this; ſo that they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to make humble Addreſſes to him, to deprecate his diſpleaſure, but to no
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:41019:88"/>
purpoſe: They ſent their Prieſts in their ſacred Veſtments, but to as little Effect: But no ſooner did his Mother, attended with his Wife and Children, come to him, but he ſubmitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to her. Now, ſays he, you have overcome me indeed, when the intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of my Mother are added to yours; tho' <hi>Rome</hi> deſerve my hatred, yet for my Mothers ſake I will ſpare it; and immediately he withdrew his Army.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond Example, is that of the worthy <hi>Athenian</hi> Captain <hi>Cimon,</hi> who not being able to redeem the Corps of his Father, which was arreſted for Debt, ſold himſelf, and became a Slave, that his deceaſed Father's Body might be freed from that Arreſt that was upon it, and ſo might have honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Burial. This great Man was famous for his Noble and Valiant Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, for his great courage and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Conduct in Military Affairs; but there was not any thing for which he was ſo much admired and loved, as for this wonderful inſtance of Affection and Reſpect to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>May not ſuch ſhining Patterns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Pagans, make many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:41019:88"/>
aſhamed, who come ſo far ſhort of them, in their Duty and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their Parents? Shall not they riſe up in Judgment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn Chriſtians, who tho' they have a more excellent, compleat, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Rule, tho' they have a great deal more Light to direct them in their Duty to their Parents; and tho' they have much greater aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to enable them to perform their Duty; do nevertheleſs carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo undutifully, and unchriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly, as if they had never heard of the Goſpel of Chriſt, yea, as if they had been born without any impreſſions of Natural Religion on their Minds, whereby all Nations are ſo far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed and enlightned, as to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that to honour, obey, love, ſerve, and aſſiſt our Parents, is a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of unqueſtionable and indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Obligation.</p>

                     <p>From what hath been ſaid, Children may ſee how great reaſon they have to perform all thoſe offices of Love, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Subjection to their Parents, that God requires of them. It remains that they ſeriouſly and impartially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, what their practice has been, and whether they have done thoſe things which God requires them to do to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Father and Mother.</p>
                     <p>That you may do this to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it's fit that you employ ſome time in looking back on your Lives, in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how you have honoured, loved, and obeyed your Parents; that you may ſee, whether you have carried your ſelves towards them, in words and deeds, as became good Children, who have a ſenſe of Religion; or whether you have not diſhonoured, neglected, and diſobeyed them.</p>
                     <p>If upon Examination of your ſelves, you find that you have done your Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that you have ſincerely endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to obey them in all things; that you have loved them heartily, and payed them that Reſpect which you
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:41019:89"/>
knew was due unto them: Bleſs God, who hath given you to will and to do according to his good pleaſure. But becauſe there are defects and imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which cleave to our exacteſt performances, therefore it is needful that you beg of God to forgive you, wherein ſoever you have been faulty, or defective in thoſe Duties you owed them. Conſider what theſe defects and imperfections are, and reſolve to amend them, and go on in doing every part of your Duty to them with greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs, and with all that perfection that's poſſible.</p>
                     <p>But if upon inquiry into your hearts and lives, you find that you have been very faulty and defective in the Duties you owe to your Parents; that you have neglected to do what you ought to have done; that inſtead of honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them, you have diſhonoured them, you have ſlighted and deſpiſed them, you have mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:41019:90"/>
and followed your own vain humour and fancy, in contempt of their Will; if inſtead of ſubmitting to their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections and chaſtenings, you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed ſubmiſſion to them, and perhaps have rebelled againſt them; if inſtead of loving them, you have hated them, and wiſhed, and deſired their death; if inſtead of relieving them in their wants, and ſupplying them with what was neceſſary for them, you have waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ſubſtance by your riotous and extravagant Living, you have put off all bowels of compaſſion and tenderneſs towards them; it, I ſay, you find that you have thus carried your ſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, in a way ſo contrary to your Duty, how ought you to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and mourn for your wickedneſs and folly? How ought you to accuſe your ſelves for your great iniquity, and to aggravate your crimes by all juſt and fit conſiderations? You may in this manner expoſtulate the caſe with your ſelves: What a ſad and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Wretch am I, who have thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured, hated, and diſobeyed my dear Parents, who are under God the Authors of my Being in the World, to whom I owe that I am? Who have
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:41019:90"/>
proved ſo undutiful to them who took care of me, when I could not take care of my ſelf? who fed and cloathed me, who were at ſo great pains and charge for me, who have employed ſo much of their time and ſtrength to provide for me all neceſſary things? and yet that I ſhould prove ſo wicked as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe them, to diſobey them, and hate them; not to ſubmit my ſelf unto them, what baſe and wicked ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is it? That I, who ſhould have been a Bleſſing to them, ſhould prove a Curſe; That I who ſhould have been a Comfort to them, ſhould be the cauſe of their grief and ſorrow? That I who ſhould have been a help unto them, ſhould be ſo great a hinderance? That I who ſhould have been the ſtay and ſupport of their Old age, ſhould prove their ruine, and the cauſe of the ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their days in anguiſh and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? What a prodigious impiety is this? What a wretched and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creature am I, who have been guilty of ſuch horrid impiety? Who have had ſo little regard to thoſe who are to me in God's ſtead here in the World? What puniſhment do I not deſerve? What a wonder is it that
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:41019:91"/>
God hath ſpared me and pitied me, and hath not cut me off in the midſt of my diſobedience, neglect, and contempt of my Parents! That he hath not made me an Example to all others, and a ſtanding Monument of his juſt diſpleaſure! That he has not bound me hand and foot, and caſt me into utter darkneſs, and given me my portion with Hypocrites and Sinners; but hath lengthened out my years, and given me time and place to repent!</p>
                     <p>Having thus in your own minds ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulated the matter with your ſelves, you may in the next place adore and bleſs the Divine Goodneſs, the infinite Mercy, and aſtoniſhing Kindneſs of God towards you, in having ſpared and pitied you; in not dealing with you after your ſins, nor rewarding you after your iniquities; but that he hath been pleaſed to wait to be gracious to you. Humbly confeſs your faults and offences unto him; with great ſhame and confuſion of face, and with true grief and ſorrow of heart acknowledge your iniquities; make particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, ſo far as you remember, of your ſtubbornneſs and diſobedience to your Parents, of your contempt and

neglect of them, of your hating them, and wiſhing Evil to them, of your ſpeaking irreverently and wickedly to them, or of them, of your not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to their Corrections, of your not heeding their Admonitions and Counſels, nor regarding their juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Beg of God, for Chriſt's ſake, to have mercy on you, and to blot out your Sins, and to make you what you ought to be.</p>
                     <p>After this, it is fit to form ſincere and hearty Reſolutions of doing your Duty, in all reſpects, to your Parents for the time to come; of loving, honouring, obeying, and ſerving them, as you ought to do. Reſolve to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend whatever has been amiſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective either in your thoughts words or deeds, with relation to them.

                     <p>If the Example and Society of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wicked Children has been an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of making you ſo bad, and of hardening you in your Contempt,

                        <pb n="149" facs="tcp:41019:92"/>You are to be careful after this, to fulfil your Purpoſes and Reſolutions, and to perform all thoſe Duties of Love, Honour, and Obedience to your Parents, wherein you were formerly ſo defective.

to do all that you can; that they who have been, by your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, or Examples, corrupted and made ſtubborn, and diſobedient, may be reformed and reſcued from their ſins and wickedneſs; that as you have been Inſtruments to promote Satan's Kingdom, ſo you may be zealous for the glory of God, for promoting Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and true Virtue in the World; whereof this is no inconſiderable part; that Children honour their Father and Mother, and do all thoſe Duties with chearfulneſs unto them, which God requires.</p>
                     <p>This is the way to obtain the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine pardon, to turn away his Wrath, and to keep off thoſe heavy Judgments which are threatned againſt ſtubborn Children, and ſuch who mock and ſcorn their Parents: Or if God ſee it fit to puniſh you here, he will make your Corrections and Puniſhments, and all other things, work together for your good; and after he hath tryed you, he will beſtow upon you rewards of everlaſting Life and Glory.</p>

God beſtows upon us his other Bleſſings in great variety and plenty; but in this he ſeems to be more ſparing, for it is given us not in large proportions, but as it were drop by drop, one minute after another; never two minutes together: when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he gives us one, he takes away another. And yet how ſtrange is it to think, that a great many ſpend their time in Vanity and Folly? Time is to many like a dead Commodity; they cannot tell what to do with it. They are ready to throw it away for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or for that which is little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:41019:96"/>
inſtead of improving and uſing it in virtuous and profitable actions and deſigns, they waſte it in trifling and vanity, which is an Argument of the greateſt Folly; as on the other hand, the right husbanding of Time is a great inſtance of true Wiſdom.</p>

It is a Metaphor taken from Merchants, who when they have a great likelihood and probability of making conſiderable gain and advantage in buying and ſelling, part with their pleaſures, or leſſer cares and concerns, that they may make a good bargain, and purchaſe that which they greatly deſire. So the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, the man that is good and wiſe, ought to deny himſelf in his pleaſures and outward delights, or even in his
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:41019:96"/>
ordinary affairs and concerns, when he has any great proſpect of doing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what conſiderable for the glory of God, the good of his Neighbour, and the benefit of his own Soul.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſon which the Apoſtle uſeth, is <hi>[Becauſe the days are evil]</hi> that is, either bad and ſinful, full of wickedneſs and folly; ſo that it is very hard and difficult then to be good, when ſin, like a violent and impetuous torrent, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries all down before it. This ought to make you redeem all occaſions of doing good, that you may fortifie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in Virtue and Piety, that you may reſcue thoſe that are carried down the ſtream by bad Example, and may build up your ſelves in Holineſs, and that you may be made ſtrong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might.

It is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for all men to refreſh their bodies with ſleep and reſt; and the ſtate of ſome mens bodies requires a great deal more than others; ſo that no exact Rules can be given about the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſleep that's proper for every one: Only in general, it is fit that all perſons redeem as much time from ſleeping, as the health of their bodies can permit; that ſo they may employ part of that time to ſome good and uſeful purpoſe, which they were wont to waſte in the ſhadow of death, as it were; whereof ſleep is the picture and repreſentation.</p>
                     <p>In the ancient Church we find many were wont to riſe up in the night to pray, that ſo they might day and night
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:41019:97"/>
keep alive in their Souls Divine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; that they might preſerve a reliſh and taſte of heavenly and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things; that excellent Objects might not be removed too far out of their ſight. This is a practice, which, perhaps, very few in theſe cold Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are able ſafely to imitate; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at ſome times of the year. The weakneſs and tenderneſs of ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies makes it to them impracticable; becauſe it would render them unfit at other times, not only for religious performances, but for the other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary actions of life. Some likewiſe have ſo little time allowed them for their repoſe in the night, that they cannot do this, in their preſent circumſtances: As for ſuch who are capable, without any ſort of inconvenience, to follow this ancient Practice, let them do it: They want not ſufficient Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereto, if they conſider that thereby they have the opportunity of flying, as it were, from theſe regions of darkneſs and miſery, of ſin and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, unto thoſe glorious regions of light and happineſs, of purity and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; there to converſe with God their chiefeſt Joy; to behold his Face,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:41019:98"/>
the light of his countenance; to taſte and ſee how good he is; to walk with him; to be ſatisfied with his Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; to drink of thoſe Rivers of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed pleaſure, which are in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, the ſtreams whereof make glad the City of God.</p>
                     <p>As for thoſe, who are not able to deny themſelves of their repoſe in the night ſeaſon; all that I ſhall ſay to them, is this; When at ſome times it pleaſeth God to take away their ſleep, and to keep them awake, let them redeem a few moments from vain thoughts, by lifting up their Souls to God, darting up ſome pious thoughts and fervent deſires Heaven-wards; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on the Goodneſs and Love of God; admiring his glorious Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; calling to mind, and conſidering his gracious Providences; longing for, and breathing after that happy ſtate when they ſhall be placed above all the infirmities and frailties of the fleſh, and outward neceſſities, above Sin and Satan, and all their Enemies: And after this, they may again compoſe themſelves to ſleep. This is a way to keep the Soul awake, to entertain it in a way worthy of it, to accuſtom it
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:41019:98"/>
to the contemplation of excellent, and divine Objects, to keep Heaven always near its view; and not to ſuffer the things of another life, to be removed too far out of ſight. We ſee in what temper of mind the Spouſe was, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2. <hi>I ſleep, but my heart waketh.</hi> Even amidſt her repoſe and ſleep, her thoughts were running after her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable and beloved Object, which poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed her heart, and filled her thoughts when ſhe was awake. And ſo it is with pious Souls ſometimes, when their thoughts have been much imployed and buſied about ſpiritual and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things in the day time, they dream of them in the Night ſeaſon. <hi>Tho' they ſleep, yet their Heart waketh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This watchful temper is an Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent means to enrich the Soul; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ſlothfulneſs, and giving up ones ſelf to drowſineſs and ſleep, cauſeth ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual beggery. <hi>An idle Soul</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 19.15.) <hi>ſhall ſuffer hunger.</hi> And <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.13. <hi>Love not ſleep, leſt thou come to Poverty: Open thine Eyes, and thou ſhalt be ſatisfied with Bread.</hi> Then was it that <hi>Samſon</hi> loſt his Hair, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was his ſtrength, when he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep. <hi>Judg.</hi> 16.19.</p>

                        <pb n="162" facs="tcp:41019:99"/>As it is a fault at any time to waſte our precious hours in this ſluggiſh and lazy manner, ſo eſpecially when God affords very favourable opportunities of doing ſome great good to our ſelves or others. <hi>He that ſleepeth in Harveſt</hi> (ſaith the Wiſe Man,) <hi>is a Son that cauſeth ſhame; Prov.</hi> 10.5. that is, he makes his Father and Friends aſhamed of him, and brings ſhame and diſgrace on himſelf. Now is the day of Grace, now is the acceptable time, now is the ſeaſon of gathering the Fruits of Righteouſneſs, and of making ſure an Harveſt of everlaſting Glory. <hi>And therefore let us not ſleep, as do others; but let us watch and be ſober.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5, 6.</p>

Read the word of God with great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and humility, with an earneſt deſire to know his will, and with a ſincere purpoſe to do it. Indeavour to feed and nouriſh your Souls by ſerious Meditation. Call on God, by humble and earneſt prayer, to pardon you, to bleſs you, to direct and proſper you in all your ways, and to ſave and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve you from all Evils Ghoſtly and Bodily. Form good purpoſes and ſtrong reſolutions to do what is good and right. Set the Lord always before you. Seek his Glory in all things, whether you eat or drink, or whatever elſe you do.</p>
                     <p>After having done thoſe things which are needful for the Soul, you may next do what is fit and decent as to your Attire and Cloathing, according to your Circumſtances in the World. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware leſt you pride your ſelves in your Apparel: Do not therein gratifie your Vanity, to go beyond others of your Rank and Quality, to make your ſelves be taken notice of more than others. Too great care about adorning the outward Man, gives juſt cauſe to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:41019:100"/>
that the chief buſineſs is neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>
                     <p>Conſider what it is that you deck and adorn with ſo much care and coſt; even a poor, vile, ſinful Body, that's full of rottenneſs and corruption; conſider that within a little while it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a very ugly, deformed, and ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Carcaſs, and be food to the Worms.</p>
                     <p>If they who beſtow ſo much time every day in painting and patching, and ſuch like things, would but beſtow a few Minutes in thinking of the Grave, and what the Body will become with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a very little time, ſo vile and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, that even they who do love it moſt dearly, will then avoid it, and be glad to have it removed out of their ſight; and that their face, which now they themſelves admire ſo much, and which they are ready to think every body elſe admires likewiſe, ſhall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a ſhort time be eaten thorough by vile Worms, and waſted and made ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Rottenneſs and Corruption, and that all its Beauty ſhall be marred: I ſay, if vain perſons would ſometimes think of theſe things, and behold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves now and then in this Glaſs, how would it humble them, and make them

                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Redeem time from Gaming and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations.

But you muſt take care that your Divertiſements and Recreations be firſt innocent and lawful, and not contrary to the Rules and Principles of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity; that they be not hurtful to your ſelves or others, nor ſcandalous and offenſive. Let them not be ſuch as thoſe of wicked men, of whom <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.23. to whom <hi>it is a ſport to do miſchief, and who make a mock of ſin;</hi> whoſe delight and divertiſement is, in ſaying things that are wicked and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, to the hurt and grief of one or other.

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:41019:102"/>
They made it a ſport to inſult and to triumph over others in their diſtreſs; they made themſelves merry with the miſeries of others.</p>
                     <p>Let your Divertiſements and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations be uſed with moderation: give not your ſelves liberty to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond due bounds, neither as to time, nor yet as to the proportion of money you play for. There is unſpeakable hurt and prejudice that comes from ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering your ſelves to be too far carried away by the fancy and humour of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and following your Sports and Paſtimes. This does inſenſibly expoſe you to the danger of poverty, as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> tells us. <hi>He that loveth pleaſure ſhall be a poor man, Prov.</hi> 21.17. This renders you unfit for all ſacred and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious performances, the mind being thereby filled with the images and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections of what you ſaid and heard, of what you and others did at your Games: Your hopes and your fears, your joys and your uneaſineſs, your vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories and loſſes, your ſurpriſes and diſappointments, your little debates and contentions, your indignation and reſentments, and a great many other things, too common at gaming, ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:41019:103"/>
and fill your mind for a great while afterwards, that when you would be ſerious, and employ your ſelves to better purpoſe, you cannot bring your minds to that fixedneſs and ſtayedneſs that is neceſſary; you remain, as it were, drunk with your Paſtimes and Divertiſements, your thoughts reel to and fro, and cannot ſettle: You have a great deſire of returning again to your Recreations, that you may gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie your fancy, and may gain more profit, or praiſe and applauſe. That you may not fall under thoſe inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies, your beſt way is to keep out of ſuch Company as makes Gaming their Buſineſs. And if at any time it be fit for you to indulge your ſelves a little in gaming, it will not be amiſs that you ſet bounds to your ſelves; both as to your time, how long to play; and as to the quantity of money you intend to play for; that you may not either in one or t'other reſpect, exceed thoſe limits which Chriſtian prudence requires. It is very adviſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble either not at all to play for money (which oft-times occaſions great ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings and quarrellings, or great unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of thought) or to play for ſo
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:41019:103"/>
very little as may be next to nothing, which may not afterwards occaſion any uneaſie reflections and diſſatisfaction of mind. And if at any time you be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and find it expedient to play for a little more than ordinary (ſtill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Rules of diſcretion and Chriſtian prudence) it would not be unfit to make it a condition in your Game, that the Winner apply what he gains to ſome charitable uſe, which you may either then expreſly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, or you may reſolve to give the money which ſhall be gained, to ſome diſcreet and charitable perſon, who will be ſure to beſtow it to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. As this would afford a great pleaſure and joy to thoſe who reap ſome fruit and benefit by your Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Paſtime; ſo it would afford your ſelves a greater delight and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, than otherwiſe you could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect by your Divertiſements. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, this would prevent covetous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and other evil paſſions and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, which uſually attend thoſe who game only, or chiefly, for profit and advantage.</p>
                     <p>As for thoſe who are apt in gaming to be tranſported into violent paſſion,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:41019:104"/>
and to break out into indecent heats, it is neceſſary for ſuch perſons to give over all ſuch Divertiſements as uſe to cauſe this exceſſive fermentation of their Spirits, and which put them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fret. Or if at any time they think good to play at ſome Game, they ought to do it in the preſence of thoſe, who by their Authority are able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them from every thing that is indecent and extravagant, that by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees they may get the victory over themſelves, and may habituate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to mildneſs and gentleneſs of Spirit, and may be preſerved from all the ſad conſequences of unruly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>

                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Redeem time from Viſiting. Too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny throw away their time in making vain and unneceſſary Viſits, employing themſelves on theſe occaſions in vain and impertinent chat, and fooliſh talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and jeſting, which are not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient; in making their Obſervations, and paſſing their Cenſures upon the Words and Actions, the Modes and Cuſtoms of others; in ſlandering and back-biting; in ſowing vain and falſe
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:41019:104"/>
Reports; in cauſing Jealouſies and Contentions, and doing other ſuch like bad Offices.</p>
                     <p>Viſiting is either good or bad, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it is managed. In ſome caſes it is very fit and neceſſary to viſit your Friends and Neighbours, to keep up thereby a friendly and neighbourly Correſpondence, to offer your help and ſervice to them when there is need of it, to ſympathize with them when they are in any ſort of trouble or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, and to aſſiſt them to bear their burdens, whether of body or mind, or outward eſtate.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the Laws of Civility and Diſcretion require that you viſit thoſe who have witneſſed great Civility and Reſpect towards you. Sometimes the good Offices and generous Favours of ſome perſons to you, require that you ſhould expreſs your grateful ſenſe of their kindneſs and generoſity, by all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible inſtances of affection and eſteem, and particularly by viſiting of them now and then, which is a very eaſie and a ſmall return for thoſe obligations they have laid upon you.</p>
                     <p>You muſt beware of viſiting or fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting the company of thoſe who
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:41019:105"/>
are very lewd and wicked, by whoſe converſation you are in great danger of being corrupted, whoſe example is ready to infect you. When you ſee a Houſe marked for the Plague, you are careful not to go into it, you keep your ſelves at a good diſtance from it, that you may not run the hazard of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. The Love which you have for life makes you do all you can to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it. Ought you not then to be as careful to keep out of the company of prophane perſons, whoſe throat is an open ſepulchre, whoſe mouths are full of blaſphemy and curſing, whoſe breath is very infectious, whoſe words and actions are full of moſt deadly poiſon, whereby your Souls are in danger of being corrupted and deſtroyed for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver? <hi>Enter not into the path of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, and go not in the way of evil men. Avoid it, paſs not by it, turn from it, and paſs away,</hi> Prov. 4.14, 15. And <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.8. He adviſeth young men to <hi>remove their way far from the ſtrange woman, and not to come nigh the door of her houſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is true, ſometimes your neceſſary affairs may oblige you to be in the company of very wicked perſons. This
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:41019:105"/>
muſt needs happen, eſpecially if men have a great deal of buſineſs in the World. But in this caſe, when you are under this neceſſity of being in ſuch company, beware leſt by word or deed you approve or countenance any thing that is bad and wicked in them; and if you cannot do them good, beware leſt they do you hurt; get away from them ſpeedily, like a Bird out of the ſnare of the Fowler.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes likewiſe your Relation wherein you ſtand to ſome perſons, or your Calling and Circumſtances where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God hath placed you, may make it your Duty to be often with thoſe who are very bad perſons; but then you ought to be, <hi>Firſt,</hi> poſſeſſed with a great abhorrence of what is evil in them, and in no manner to approve their ſin and folly. Have no Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with their unfruitful works of darkneſs. <hi>Secondly,</hi> You ought to make uſe of all favourable opportunities to endeavour to make them better, and to reſcue them from their evil ways and doings. If you obſerve theſe things, you are not partakers with them in their ſins, and therefore God will not lay them to your charge.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="176" facs="tcp:41019:106"/>If at any time atheiſtical and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane perſons follow after you, and thruſt themſelves into your Company, beware of them, and ſhake off their Society, unleſs you converſe with them with a deſign to reform them, and to bring them off from their evil practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and have ground to hope that you may do them good. But when after having tryed twice or thrice to make them better, you find you only caſt Pearls before Swine, and that there is more danger of getting hurt by them, than of doing them good, it is fit that you deal roundly and plainly with them, and that you let them know, that ſo long as they are no better, you deſire to be excuſed, if you do not keep company with them. Tho' plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is very neceſſary in this caſe, yet it is fit that it be tempered with all the diſcretion and ſweetneſs that's poſſible, otherwiſe it may do more hurt than good. Endeavour to make ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſenſible that you are only an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to their Vices, and that as for their perſons you will be always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to do them all good offices.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> As you ought carefully to avoid the company of thoſe who are
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:41019:106"/>
prophane and atheiſtical perſons, ſo it is your intereſt, as well as Duty, to viſit thoſe who are good and religious. <hi>They who feared the Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi, ch.</hi> 3.16.) <hi>ſpake often one to another.</hi> When you have the opportunity of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the company of ſuch perſons, make the beſt uſe of it that you can. <hi>Conſider one another to provoke unto love, and to good works,</hi> Heb. 10.24. <hi>Exhort one another daily,</hi> Heb. 3.13. Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, comfort, and, in a friendly and loving manner, reprove one another, as there is need. Make uſe of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Counſel and Advice in any thing that is doubtful and difficult. By all diſcreet and prudent ways endeavour to learn ſome good and uſeful thing from good and wiſe perſons, with whom you have occaſion to converſe. <hi>Counſel in the heart of a man,</hi> ſaith <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, is as deep waters; but a man of underſtanding draws it out,</hi> Prov. 20.5. Counſel, that is, a skill and dexterity to give good Advice and Counſel, and to talk of things which tend to make men wiſer and better. This in the heart of a wiſe man is like deep waters, that is, it makes no great noiſe (the wiſeſt men being alſo the modeſteſt) and is
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:41019:107"/>
not come at without ſome pains, and ſome prudent Arts and Methods: But a man of underſtanding draws it out, that is, by diſcreet and ſeaſonable que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions and other fit ways, he gives his wiſe Friend an opportunity to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, to communicate his thoughts, and to diſcover his wiſdom and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
                     <p>Beware leſt in good Company your Diſcourſe vaniſh into air and ſmoak; leſt it be too trifling, and about things vain and impertinent. <hi>Let your words be ſeaſoned with ſalt, miniſtring grace to the hearers,</hi> Col. 4.6. Endeavour to receive benefit from the Society of thoſe who are good and wiſe, and to do them good, ſo far as you can, by your Society.</p>
                     <p>It is true, it is not only lawful, but ſometimes very convenient and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when virtuous and excellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons meet together, that they recreate and divert themſelves a little by chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and innocent mirth, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their minds may be made more fit for ſerious and ſacred things. Such is the ſtate and condition of man, while in the body, that his Soul cannot be always employed about thoſe things
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:41019:107"/>
which are of a Divine and Spiritual Nature: This vigour and ſtrength of Soul is not, perhaps, attained to by any on this ſide the Grave. However, our care muſt be, that the bent and inclination of our hearts be toward thoſe things that are good and uſeful. This muſt be our buſineſs, our way and courſe, to be good, and to do good: And as for our Recreations and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements, they muſt only be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the other.</p>

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:41019:108"/>
ſome extraordinary opportunity for doing good to your Chriſtian Brother, or to your own Souls: Then you muſt ſell things of leſſer value, that you may buy time for doing that which will make you rich in the true Riches; that you may edifie your Brother, and build up your ſelves in true Virtue.</p>
                     <p>The great matter is to know when you are to do ſo. You muſt not every time when a ſudden thought ariſeth in your mind, moving you to leave your Plough, or your Trade and Calling, and to give up your ſelves to ſome Acts of Religion and Devotion; you muſt not, I ſay, preſently ſet on this the ſtamp or ſeal of a Divine Inſpiration, and a Call from Heaven. This, if not taken heed to, may lead you into great miſtakes and errours, and very dangerous deluſions. Sometimes Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, or other bodily Diſtempers, may give occaſion to a great many warm fancies and imaginations: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you are not to follow thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate motions and inclinations; if you are not ſome other way determined thereto, by ſome concurring evidence of the hand of God. For Example, if, when you are moved in your own
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:41019:108"/>
mind to do ſome very good and pious work, there happen about the ſame time an outward Call to do the ſame thing, you may conclude there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what extraordinary in this to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine you. By an outward Call, I do not mean any extraordinary Voice from Heaven: that's not to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but a Call by ſome good, wiſe, and diſcreet perſon, who unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſires and invites you to do that, which before his ſpeaking of it to you, you found your own heart moved and inclined you to. In which caſe you have a very mighty encouragement, both from the goodneſs and uſefulneſs of the thing it ſelf, and from the Call and invitation which you have had from another, of whoſe wiſdom and piety you are ſufficiently aſſured. Tho' there be no more but this Call from Man, it is of great weight to move you, and to determine you in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to redeem your time from your ordinary labour, when there is ſome extraordinary occaſion of doing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what for the honour of God, or the good of men. Thus if at any time you are invited to comfort one that is in any great trouble of body or mind,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:41019:109"/>
or in any other great diſtreſs and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; if there be any thing in your power to do for the comfort and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of ſuch a perſon, you ought to ſhew your readineſs to do your utmoſt for his help and ſupport. You know not but the Lord may make uſe of you (however weak and unfit you may think your ſelves) to ſerve the deſigns of his Mercy and Love. Likewiſe, if you are called to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile thoſe that are at variance; to ſee if you can awaken a perſon from his ſin and folly, eſpecially when the Lord's hand is upon him; to give your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and Advice in ſome extraordinary caſe, where it is judged needful for you ſo to do: In theſe and the like caſes you ought chearfully to ſacrifice your private gain and advantage, and to let your leſſer cares give place to thoſe of a more publick and conſiderable nature. Theſe things you are only to do, ſo far as the neceſſity of your own occaſions will permit. They who are ſetled in a Calling, and have a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are under a very ſtrict obligation to take care of their Family, and to mind their Calling and Employment; they muſt not neglect thoſe neceſſary
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:41019:109"/>
Duties which God hath given them to do in their ſeveral ſtations. The Scripture accounts them worſe than Infidels, who provide not for their Houſe, and thoſe of their own Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But if the Circumſtances of your affairs will permit you to comply with the Opportunities of performing ſome eminent acts of Piety and Zeal, you ought not to neglect them: God will not fail plentifully to reward your Love to him, and your Zeal for his Glory.</p>

A great many do not waſte much time in ſleep, in dreſſing and adorning of their bodies, in eating and in drinking, in gaming or in viſiting, and yet they waſte their time: But how? in doing nothing, in entertaining themſelves with the vain imaginations of their fooliſh minds, feeding on the Wind, purſuing dreams, and catching at ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, building Caſtles in the Air, and ſporting themſelves with their own vain conceits and fooliſh fancies. <hi>Their Eyes are,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>in the ends
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:41019:110"/>
of the Earth,</hi> Prov. 17.24. They mind thoſe things moſt which concern them leaſt. They buſie themſelves about what others ſay and do, but do nothing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to any good purpoſe. Some men are full of vain and uſeleſs contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, wherewith they do indeed buſie themſelves: But to what end? When all their deſigns and vain contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are accompliſhed, they are but as ſo many Spiders Webs, only fit to catch flyes. This is to be buſie in Trifles, to be imployed in doing as good as nothing. Thus there be ſome who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue a ſtudious life night and day, with a wonderful diligence; but their ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies being only in impertinent books, and about deſigns of no uſe, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of very bad uſe, they gain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing thereby; yea ſo far are they from reaping any benefit by their great pains and labour, that they are unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able loſers; they loſe their time, and ſometimes they loſe their Wealth, and their Health, if not their Reaſon and Underſtanding.</p>
                     <p>Conſider, <hi>firſt,</hi> how unworthy this ſort of life is of men and of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans? God hath made you to be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to glorifie him, to do good in the

World, to become daily more and more holy and religious, to grow in grace, and to perfect holineſs in his fear; and not to be like an uſeleſs log, or an inſignificant Cypher, not to be barren and unfruitful in his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard. Strive therefore to live up to the end and deſign of your being in the World, to improve your ſelves in Piety and Virtue, to do ſomewhat that may be of real advantage to the Souls and Bodies of others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> conſider how dangerous a thing it is to live an idle, vain, and unuſeful life. God hath promiſed Men his protection, only when they are in the way of their Calling, when they imploy themſelves in that ſtate of life, wherein by his Providence he hath ſetled them in the World. So the Pſalmiſt inſtructs us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.11. <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways;</hi> that is, in all honeſt and lawful undertakings, and in all actions that belong to your Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. So that if you are idle, and give up your ſelves to a lazy and uſeleſs manner of living in the World, doing nothing that's profitable to your ſelves or others, you put your ſelves out of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:41019:111"/>
God's protection, and thereby you give the Devil advantage over you, and you lay your ſelves open to all his Temptations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Conſider that the end of this idle and uſeleſs life is very ſad. <hi>Caſt the unprofitable Servant into utter darkneſs, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth, Math.</hi> 25.30. Not only ſhall wicked Servants be caſt into utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but alſo unprofitable Servants, <hi>who hide their Talents in a Napkin;</hi> that is, who do not imploy to any good purpoſe thoſe Gifts which God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows upon them, who ſtand idle all the day long in the Vineyard.</p>
                     <p>

When you read, and pray, and meditate, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine your ſelves, and hear the word of God preached, and ſing his praiſes, and partake of the holy Sacrament, and perform other acts of Religion and Piety, in a lifeleſs, dull, unconcerned and formal manner, you loſe your time;
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:41019:111"/>
and therefore when by due reflection upon your ways, you find that you do ſo, endeavour afterwards to redeem it, by greater watchfulneſs and ſeriouſneſs; otherwiſe you may go on a great while in a courſe of Devotion to very little purpoſe, if you do not ſtir up your ſelves to do the beſt that's in your power to do by God's help.</p>
                     <p>Thus when you find that you have read the Word of God in a careleſs and negligent manner, without conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring whoſe Word it is, and for what end it is written, and without thoſe diſpoſitions of mind that are neceſſary; you muſt afterwards endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the time, by being more careful to read that ſacred Book with greater reverence and ſeriouſneſs, and with greater pleaſure and delight. Pray to God more heartily for his direction and aſſiſtance. Meditate more atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively on what you read, and lay it up in your hearts, that it may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in a readineſs for your uſe, as the rule of your lives.</p>
                     <p>If you find that you have loſt your time in prayer, by not making your Addreſſes to God with a deep humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and reverence, with unfeigned

Faith, and fervent Love, and with great earneſtneſs, ſincerity, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity; endeavour afterwards to pray with all poſſible humility and reverence, with greater Faith and Confidence, and with a mighty earneſtneſs and ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Spirit: Study to have your Souls poſſeſſed with a deeper ſenſe of your wants and neceſſities, that you may beg ſupplies of all needful things from him who can help you to the utmoſt. Be more ſenſible of the greatneſs of your ſins, and of the many hainous ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations that attend them, that you may make humble confeſſion of them with true ſorrow and contrition. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the danger to which your Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, or formality and lukewarmneſs in religious Duties do expoſe you, that you may with great integrity and uprightneſs of Soul, make your Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to the ſearcher of Hearts, and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Reins, who takes pleaſure in the hearty and chearful ſervices of thoſe who draw near unto him. Be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with more lively impreſſions of the Divine Power and Greatneſs, of the Juſtice, Holineſs, Goodneſs, Mercy and Faithfulneſs of God, that the ſenſe thereof may make you adore him, and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:41019:112"/>
call upon him in ſuch a manner as is ſuitable to ſo glorious a Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>If you find that the time you have ſet apart for ſelf Examination has been loſt, by a negligent performance of this Duty, by your not being in good earneſt, when you pretended to call your ſelves to an account: Endeavour to redeem the time, by ſearching your hearts, and enquiring into your ways with greater care and exactneſs. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine and try your ſelves, as in the ſight of God, as Men that are in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to ſave their Souls from everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condemnation. Deal impartially with your ſelves; do not extenuate your own Faults, but aggravate them by all juſt and fit conſiderations: En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be deeply touch'd with hearty Contrition and real Grief and Sorrow for them; let your repentance in all regards be more ſincere, and unfeigned, and your purpoſes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutious more ſtrong and ſteady. If you find that you have reflected on God's Mercies and Favours to you, without that grateful ſenſe which you ought to have had thereof, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making ſuitable returns, ſo far as you were able by his Grace, for his
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:41019:113"/>
great and undeſerved goodneſs; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour afterwards to employ your thoughts on ſo delightful a ſubject, as is the Divine Love and Goodneſs, with greater pleaſure, and with a more live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſe thereof than you have been wont. Let the conſideration of the love and goodneſs of God, powerfully move you, and prevail with you to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what which may teſtifie the reality of your gratitude, ſomewhat that may be of real benefit to the Souls or Bodies of others.</p>
                     <p>If you find that you have been very formal and careleſs in performing what relates to the publick Worſhip, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to redeem the time, by being more ſincere and devout. For Example, if you have heard the Word of God read and preached, in a trifling and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned manner, without thoſe diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of mind which were requiſite in a Chriſtian Hearer, and in an humble Diſciple of Jeſus Chriſt; if you have attended on ſuch occaſions, more out of compliance with Cuſtom, and the Example of others, than out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and from Principles of true Religion and Devotion; Conſider that this is to loſe time, and, under an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:41019:113"/>
of Religion, to remain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any thing of it in reality. You muſt therefore afterwards endeavour to hear the Word of God in another manner, to wit, as the Law and Rule of your Lives, as that which is given you of God to make you wiſe and good, and to fit you for everlaſting Happineſs and Glory; you muſt, as new born Babes, deſire the ſincere Milk of the Word, that your Souls may grow thereby. You muſt hear it with great reverence and attention, and with humble and tractable minds; you muſt ſtudy to have it ingrafted in your hearts, that it may abide there as a Scion in a ſtock, and may grow and bear fruit unto everlaſting life. You muſt reflect on what you hear; when you leave the Church, you muſt not lay aſide all further thinking on what has been read or preached to you; you are to talk a little with your own hearts about thoſe things, and to call to mind any thing you heard, which tends to make you wiſer and better: Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to have it deeply imprinted on your Souls, that it may prove unto you the Power of God unto Salvation, the ſavour of life unto life.</p>

                        <pb n="192" facs="tcp:41019:114"/>If you find that you have been too often guilty of ſinging the Praiſes of God with your mouths only, without any melody in your hearts, without any real ſenſe of the greatneſs and power, of the kindneſs and love, of the patience and long-ſuffering, of the truth and faithfulneſs of him whom you praiſe and celebrate: Endeavour to be more devout and ſerious in that part of Worſhip; ſing unto God, not only with you Voice, but with your Heart, which is the chief thing that God looks to. Study to raiſe your Souls to him, as well as to lift up your Voices when you ſing his praiſes. Stir up all within you to bleſs his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Name, <hi>who forgiveth all your Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and healeth all your diſeaſes, who crowneth you with loving kindneſs and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mercies,</hi> who prevents you every Morning, and follows you all the day long, with many ſignal inſtances of his Fatherly care and love, giving you richly all things to enjoy for life and godlineſs.</p>
                     <p>If you find that you joyn in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayers without any due Senſe of God upon your Souls, and without any real impreſſion of thoſe things to

Bid farewell to your World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Cares and to your Pleaſures, and Vanities, when you come into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to pay your homage to him. Serve him with your beſt affections, with the ſtrength and vigour of your deſires, and with all your power and might. If you do this, you may then expect, with great aſſurance and confidence, that God will give ear unto you, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy your longing Souls with good things, he will make you taſte and ſee how good he is. But if you pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being in good earneſt, your Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices will be an abomination to him,

Come with your Souls burning with love to him who dyed for you, and who appointed you this Sacrament, that therein you might remember his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful love, and his aſtoniſhing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion and mercy, which he hath teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in laying down his life for ſinners, that he might purchaſe to them ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life and Glory, even to as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as repent and believe the Goſpel.

Come with your hearts deeply wounded and pierced with ſorrow for your ſins and follies, which were the cauſe of ſo ſhameful, ſo painful, and ſo curſed a death to your deareſt Lord and Saviour. Come with your Souls full of ſincere and hearty purpoſes and reſolutions of being new Creatures, not to live any more unto your ſelves, or unto the World, but to him who dyed for you.

How many ſickneſſes and diſtempers, and how many ſudden ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents are there in the way, which may ſhorten your day, and cauſe your Sun to ſet, when you think it ſhines with its greateſt force and luſtre?

Sometimes a Candle is blown out by the Wind, or ſnufft out undeſigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when it is not yet half burnt. And ſo the life of Man is often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by outward accidents, when by the courſe of Nature, it might have been prolonged much further.</p>
                     <p>How many come forth into the World, and give great appearances of making a very conſiderable figure in it by their Wiſdom and Sagacity, their good Conduct, and Addreſs, their excellent Parts and uſeful Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, their Courage and Valour, their charming Eloquence, and clear and diſtinct Reaſoning, or by their ſhining Piety and burning Zeal? But do not you ſee how ſuddenly they are gone? they are hurried away by death, and you neither ſee them nor hear of them any more.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing certain as to your time, but its ſhortneſs and uncertainty. Nothing can ſecure you againſt an unexpected blow by death, when God ſees fit to give charge to the King of terrors to knock you down. Youth and ſtrength cannot do it; for how many dye when their Breaſts are full of milk, and their bones are moiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

with marrow? Too great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Blood and Spirits do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times oppreſs and ſtifle the life of Man. Wealth and Riches cannot ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure you: How many great and weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy men have been ſuddenly carried away as with a Flood, when their Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers were full of Silver and Gold, when they had all that heart could wiſh? Even their Wealth proved the bait which allured idle, covetous, and deſperate perſons, to break into their Houſes and rob them, not only of their Treaſure, but of their lives.</p>
                     <p>Greatneſs of Power and earthly Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Dignity are not able to do it: Crowns and Scepters, Caſtles and Palaces, a wiſe Council, and great Armies, are not able to protect Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from the violent and deſperate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of Men who are prodigal of their lives. How many of thoſe who have been moſt famous in the World for their Power and Greatneſs, have been very unexpectedly removed by a violent and ſudden death? When they have been in their greateſt heighth, at the very top of Earthly Felicity, and full of the deepeſt Projects and Deſigns; when they made account to
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:41019:120"/>
make the Earth, as it were, to tremble; to humble and to mortifie their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to enlarge their own Dominions, or to enſlave their Subjects, even then Death gave them a ſudden blow, and ſo there was an end of them and their deſigns together.</p>
                     <p>But may not Wiſdom and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, great Learning, and skill in various Arts and Sciences, do ſomewhat to ſecure men from the ſudden blow of Death? No, all this cannot do it: We ſee even Wiſe men ſuddenly and unexpectedly removed from us by death, as well as others. In the midſt of their uſeful Studies, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent contrivances, and deſigns, the King of terrors puts a ſtop to them, and in the twinkling of an Eye they are gone, and all their thoughts are laid aſleep. So vain a thing is Man, and even the wiſeſt Man; and ſo uncertain is his time.</p>
                     <p>Conſider that Death can enter by a thouſand doors. Every pore in your Body is a gate wide enough for Death to enter in at. Do not you ſee what a ſmall thing makes way for Death? The prick of a Thorn, or a Splinter of Wood does it ſometimes,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:41019:120"/>
by occaſioning a Fever, or a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene. How quickly are ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by violent and unexpected Diſtempers, and ſometimes on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den are ſtruck dead, you cannot tell how? Have not ſome dyed through an exceſs of joy, and others through immoderate grief; ſome by exceſſive laughter, and others by too much mourning and weeping? Some have dyed with a fright or ſudden fear: ſome by the violence of their anger and wrath, and others by an exceſs of love. How many have been killed with over much care and too great watching? and others have occaſioned their own death by idleneſs and too much ſleep: Some have killed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with eating and drinking, and others have done it by too great abſtinence and faſting. Have not ſome dyed while they have been at Meals, by a Crumb or a little Bone, or ſome ſuch very ſmall matter? When they were thinking to repair their ſtrength, and to fit themſelves for going on with their buſineſs and work; that which they did to ſave and length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en out their lives, did ſhorten them, and put an end to them.

                     <p>But beſides all this, conſider that when you go abroad, you are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from innumerable accidents. You may be killed by the noiſom ſteams of the Earth, by ſome infectious quality in the Air, by the Beaſts of the field, by the teeth of Dogs, by the horns of mad Oxen, or by the heels of wild Horſes.

holy Angels, with a ſhout, with the voice of the Archangel, and with the Trump of God. He ſhall ſend his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and they ſhall gather together his Elect from the four Winds, from one end of Heaven to the other. The Throne ſhall be ſet, and all Nations ſhall be gathered before him.

You profeſs to believe theſe things, and therefore ought you not ſo to live, and ſo to husband your time, that when the Judge cometh, he may not find you idle, nor doing ſuch things as are to his diſhonour?</p>
                     <p>You may conceive ſomewhat (tho' but very little) concerning the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thoughts of good and bad men, upon ſuch a ſudden appearance of the Judge.

But the naughty and wicked Servants muſt needs be filled with ſhame and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon the Coming of their Lord, ſo as not to be able to look him in the face: There is no other thing which they can do, but to endeavour to fly from his preſence, that they may not fall under the weight of his terrible diſpleaſure.</p>
                     <p>In this manner our Lord and Maſter Jeſus, before he left the World, gave Rules and Commands to his Servants

how to employ themſelves, and what to do till his return. He promiſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to all who ſhould believe and obey, and threatned the unbelievers, and the diſobedient with heavy Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and moſt dreadful Judgments. When he comes again in the great Day to judge the World, the godly ſhall meet him with great hope and aſſurance, of obtaining the end of their Faith, even the Salvation of their Souls. But the wicked and unbelievers ſhall be full of horrour and confuſion, and ſhall cry to the mountains to fall on them, to hide them from the face of their Judge, who will be a conſuming fire to all the workers of iniquity, and will in no wiſe clear the guilty.</p>

                     <p>The Mariners wait for a favourable Gale, a fair and ſeaſonable Wind to go to Sea: And when it blows accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their wiſhes, they are ſure not to loſe one moment. Their deſire of gain, and their hopes of a proſperous Voyage, makes them venture. And yet after all they may and often do ſuffer ſhipwrack, and loſe their goods and their lives too. But the Chriſtian who redeems his time, is in no ſuch danger; he is ſure to arrive ſafely at the Harbour of everlaſting Reſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the ſtorms and tempeſts which he meets with in the boiſterous Sea of this World.</p>
                     <p>The Husbandmen wait for a good ſeaſon to plough and ſow, and to do
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:41019:129"/>
all other things belonging to their Employment; and when the time is favourable, they are ſure to make uſe of it. The deſire and hopes they have of a Harveſt, of a fruitful Crop, quickens their endeavours, and excites their induſtry. And yet after all, they may be diſappointed. Their Corn may be drowned by violent Rains, or ſcorched and burnt up with violent Heat, or eaten up and conſumed by Inſects, Fowls, or Beaſts. But the Chriſtian who <hi>ſows in tears, ſhall reap in joy,</hi> Pſal. 126.5, 6.</p>
                     <p>You ſee that men, who run a Race, ſtrive with great earneſtneſs to gain the Prize, to obtain that, which oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is of no very great value. And yet ſome of thoſe who run come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and are diſappointed of their hopes. But the Chriſtian runs not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainly; he is ſure to <hi>obtain not a corruptible Crown, but an incorruptible,</hi> 1. Cor. 9.25.</p>
                     <p>Again, you ſee that men who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege a City or a Caſtle, wait for all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and are ſure not to neglect a favourable occaſion of making an Aſſault, and ſurpriſing the Enemy. The hopes of getting rich Spoils, of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:41019:129"/>
gaining Honour and Renown, makes them reſolute and valiant. And yet it often happens, that they loſe their lives in the Attempt; or are taken captive by thoſe whom they did hope to overcome and ſubdue. But he who fights the good fight of Faith, is ſure to lay hold on eternal Life. He who fights under Chriſt's Banner, and who has him for his Captain, is ſure to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Victory over all his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall conclude this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with what is written by St. <hi>Peter,</hi>

Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 10, 11, &amp;c. <hi>The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in the which the Heavens ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe, and the Elements ſhall melt with fervent heat, the Earth alſo, and the works that are therein, ſhall be burnt up. Seeing then that all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved, what manner of perſons ought you to be in all holy converſation and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; Looking for, and haſtening unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the Heavens being on fire ſhall be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the Elements ſhall melt with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent heat?
